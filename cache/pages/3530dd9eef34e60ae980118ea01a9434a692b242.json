Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns. The only problem is that, at least as far as I can tell, neither seem to express or even harbor any sort of feelings of endearment for each other. I won't deny those connections between licht, tetia, yuno, and mimosa, but the ways things are currently it would feel like a forced 180 for both of their characters. Depending on how long the series goes on for, there's still plenty of time for a relationship to start being developed between them, especially after what happened in the latest chapter. Yuno cried for time since he was a kid. That is a huge development, because it means going forward Yuno will likely no longer be bottling up his emotions and will be expressing them more freely. So far Mimosa has only seen one side of Yuno, the cold and distant side that doesn't seem to care about anything, but if he starts to become more emotional and openly express care for others, that might make her start to view Yuno in a different light. Girls are more attracted to guys who are sensitive and in touch with their emotions than they are to those who don't show any. In reality they would find guys like Yuno boring, but if Yuno starts to have more of a personality and showing emotion then he will no longer seem like such a boring person to be around, and Mimosa may start to find him attractive and desirable as a result. Damn, you really want this ship to happen... Okay before the i started to watch black clover i thought they are endgame too just because they are same team like asta and noelle are same team lol Yeah it has potential but i wouldnt say they will end up together right now. Wouldnt that make them... related? Oh well its medieval era so... I'd say roll tide, but it's Noelle who has the water magic... Roll tide roll evan though we loss yesterday Yuno being a reincarnation doesn’t mean he’s related to Licht. Comment removed by moderator Recently delved deeper into lotr lore and Aragorn is actually arwens first cousin 63 times removed. So this is less incesty than that to me 🤷♂️ What Yuno is loved by mana. Obviously he marries mana in the end. Next question. Best answer Honestly, I'm not even sure Yuno has ever said Mimosa's name on screen, ever. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Next chapter Asta is going to show up and Yuno is going to go through the same line of dialog Noelle did and end with the \"I love Asta\" line. Turning the Noelle, Mimosa love triangle into a love rectangle Mimosa is a bit dry for Yuno.. Who himself is a bit dry... And really sweet.. I think he needs someone with more of an edge... But if they went this route.. That would mean that mimosa finally stopped spending all her time with the black bulls... I really would like to know how she feels about her squad getting cut in half among other things Mimosa actually seems really wet whenever Asta is around I am an anime only. I honestly wish for mimosa x asta cuz They look good together. Noelle is also good but i prefer Mimosa. She gives me early hinata vibes. Hehe Nahhh I'm not sure. I honestly wouldn't mind if their relationship is developed properly. The problem with your main point (Yuno representing Licht here, and Mimosa representing Tetia here) is that it kinda sounds uncomfortable. Because if Yuno is Tetia's descendant, and Mimosa is Lumiere's descendant (that one was confirmed) that'd mean their ancestors were blood related so it's kinda weird. Yuno is not Tetia's descendant tho just her son's reincarnation. Wasn’t there like a 500 year gap between the elf massacre and now? A relation that distant is pretty negligible. I mean they don't actually have any visible feelings harboured on either side, whilst I am basing this on what I've seen in the anime, Yuno doesn't seen to like Nyone and only Charmy, Sylph and that one girl from his squad seems to like him whilst, Mimosa likes Asta, on the topic of the Rill thing so far he doesn't seem to get that Charmy's other form is still Charmy and his interest in her still feels shallow, whilst admittedly Charmy's interest in Yuno is still pretty dumb, she can at least consistently recognise him, whilst it's nice that bothe Rill and Charmy are the same age, and at least one of them likes the other there isn't really enough to go on. I think it will be Yuno×Bell"
