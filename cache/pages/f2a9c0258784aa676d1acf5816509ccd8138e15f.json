Attractions worth visiting Żywiec is a charming, historical city located in the Silesian Voivodeship, on the route No. 69 from Zwardoń to Bielsko-Biała, between the Little Beskids, Silesian Beskids, as well as the Żywiec Beskids, on the Soła River and the picturesque Żywiec Lake. What makes Żywiec so special is the fact that they surround it from every side of the mountain, creating an extremely picturesque view! Żywiec is famous for its good beer. The popular brewery lies in the southern part of the city, but also with its beautiful monuments and vividly cultivated tradition. Every summer, Beskid CultureDays are held here,an interesting folk outdoor event, held in the amphitheater on the Barracks. Experiences in Żywiec There is no shortage of attractions in Żywiec, both on the trail, even in the mountains, and typical urban attractions. The Castle Park deserves special attention. The castle-palace complex captivates here. They delight with beautiful views from the surrounding peaks. Although not high, it is picturesque. See the most beautiful attractions of Żywiec, which we have also marked on the map to make it easier to locate. Market Square in Żywiec The most valuable monuments are concentrated near the revitalized Market Square, which is a pleasant meeting place. The characteristic town hall and the large inscription Żywiec will not allow you to confuse this city with any other. On the opposite side, to the town hall, there were cafes with terraces outside. There is a lot of flowers on the market square in Żywiec, it would be nice to see additional trees. Co-Cathedral with an observation tower One step from the market square to the bell tower and the magnificent co-cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Żywiec. It comes from the middle of the 15th century and has a very interesting, slightly dark interior. Built in the 16th century, the tower of the co-cathedral is about 70 meters long and is accessible to tourists. You can buy a ticket at the Przystań opposite café. The entrance takes place every 30 minutes, and the observation deck is located at a height of about 40 meters. You have to climb more than 100 stairs! The panorama of the city and the surrounding peaks, although obscured by the grid, is fantastic, and the height really noble! You can walk around the tower and admire the panorama of all parts of the world. Tickets for the tower available at the Przystań Café opposite the tower Castle in Żywiec Right next to the co-cathedral, behind the ornate gate, there is a castle in Żywiec housing the Municipal Museum. It is the so-called Old Castle (in contrast to the palace called the New Castle) from the 15th century. The Municipal Museum offers interesting exhibitions here - on the historical and sacral floor, in the archaeological courtyard and a captivating exhibition of torture tools. In the outbuildings there is an ethnographic exhibition (in Wozownia) and a nature exhibition. The old castle also boasts a beautiful courtyard with cloisters. Entrance to the courtyard is free, only exhibitions are available after purchasing a ticket. There is also a Tourist Information Point in the castle ticket office. https://www.muzeum-zywiec.pl/ Habsburg Palace The palace is the so-called New Castle. It is located directly opposite the Old Castle, forming a common complex with it. Unfortunately, at present the palace is not open to the public, as well as a small park of miniatures created outside its walls, in the park. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful building that is worth seeing from the outside. The palace dates back to the 18th century, and in the 19th century it was rebuilt by the Habsburgs, giving the building its current shape. It was inhabited by Princess Alicja Habsburg, who, together with her husband Archduke Charles, lived in the Żywiec Palace in 1920-45. The war forced them to leave the place. An interesting fact is that after years of wandering, in 1993, their daughter, Princess Maria Krystyna Altenburg of the Habsburgs, who died here in 2012, lived here. Castle Park in Żywiec At the castle and the Habsburg Palace there is a magnificent historic castle park - a beautiful walking place with a fountain and age-old vegetation. You will see here the oldest oak in the Żywiec region. He is about 370 years old and is named Francis. The Miniature Park with models of monuments from Podbeskidzie was created in the Park a few years ago. In 2012,a bench was placed next to Princess Alicja Habsburg, who lived in the Palace in 1920-45. The park also delights in the interesting Chinese Cottage - which turns into an ice cream parlor in the summer. At one of the alleys you will see an old oak tree named Franciszek. It is about 370 years old. It is the oldest tree in the Żywiec region. Around it spills a pond with waterfowl, and around you can find nice bridges. Free car parks are also available at Witosa Street. City Stable and Mini Zoo At the edge of the Park, from Witosa Street, there is a very nice Mini Zoo and Municipal Stable waiting for children. The access from Witosa Street is much closer than from Zamkowa Street, especially since there are free parking lots nearby on this street. The entire mini zoo complex is available free of charge, it's a lot of fun for the little ones, although we, adults, also like it here. In addition to horses, there are goats, rabbits, pigs, chickens and other birds. You will surely be surprised by the completely white peacocks, which together with these colorful ones present their wonderful tails here. Brewery in Żywiec The historic Żywiec Brewery, which houses the Brewery Museum (ul. Browarna 88), is also attractive in Żywiec. Once open only to tourists for 18 years, today it invites entire families to its unique interiors. The brewery in Żywiec is an important element ofthe Route of Technical Monuments. https://muzeumbrowaru.pl/ Church of the Holy Cross in Żywiec Not far from the Market Square in Żywiec, it is worth approaching the historic church of the Holy Cross on Stefan Batory Street. This gothic church captivates with its beauty, and is also the oldest preserved temple in the city. You will also see a penitential cross in front of him. Kościuszki Street leads here from the market square. The church from the main square of the city is very close, several hundred meters away. Grojec Numerous hiking trails lead from the centre of Żywiec to the peaksof the Żywiec Beskids. The most popular is Grojec, consisting of three peaks - Grojec Mały (423 m above sea level), Grojec Średni (474 m above sea level) and the highest (612 m above sea level). All the peaks are connected by the yellow trail running from the Żywiec market square. We entered this trail by the amphitheater, overlooking Koszarawa. There are free parking lots (Witosa Street), as well as ice cream, beer, snacks and a nice walking path. It is very picturesque here. Most often tourists go to Grojec Średni, because it is easily accessible, wide and flat. It is a great place for a family picnic, and also offers wonderful views, with a panorama of the Silesian Beskids, Mały, Żywiec and Żywiec Lake. Skrzyczne and Góra Żar emerge. There is a place for a bonfire under the cross and you can even bake sausages, great thing. Żywiec Lake An additional great attraction in Żywiec is the well-developed Żywiec Lake. The embankment over this picturesque reservoir attracts here from the city. You can even walk here from the centre. We parked the car at Sienkiewicza Street, from where several steps lead to the path. But it's beautiful here: pedestrians, cyclists and a wonderful lake. You can walk along the path to the St. Vitus Source and return (it is about 700 meters from Sienkiewicza Street), or go further by the water, overlooking Skrzyczne, Mount Żar and other peaks. It is wonderful! Góra Żar A good idea for a trip in the vicinity of Żywiec is Góra Żar - the centre of gliding and paragliding. You can reach the top of the mountain by a roller coaster. The access is also not very demanding, because the car parks are located quite high on the slope. The summit is very scenic. Where to eat in Żywiec Żywiec is a popular city among tourists, so there are quite a few opportunities to drink coffee or eat a hot meal here. Already on the market, there are atmospheric cafes with umbrellas, and opposite the co-cathedral I recommend the Przystań Café, with ice cream, waffles, tasty cakes and various types of coffees. There is also a children's corner. For ice cream, it's also nice to go to the park, to the charming Chinese Cottage, by the pond. For a quick meal, you can visit the Viva la Sorpresa pizzeria near the park (33a Kościuszki Street). The pizza is scathing, but the fries are great 🙂 For real, however, I recommend the Food&Rest Inn (Nad Łękawką 15). It's outside the center of Żywiec, on the road to Ślemenie, but it's worth a look. Tasty Polish cuisine, in a nice environment where you can park, walk and relax from the hustle and bustle. Żywiec - map of attractions and walk We give you a map with highlighted attractions of this nice city. You will also find our cafes and restaurants here. And here is our proposal for a walk around the attractions of Żywiec. We will also go to Grojec to watch it from above, so put on comfortable shoes, although it will not be difficult. The whole thing is about 5 km one way. We will start the trip in the spacious parking lot at the shopping mall. At the beginning, we will visit the Church of the Holy Cross, then we will enter the market square and the co-cathedral. If you want to climb its tower, you have to enter the Przystań cafe to get the key. You can eat well here. Then a castle and a palace park with a Chinese Cottage and a mini zoo. You can leave the park on Witosa Street and relax on the shore of Koszarawa. If you have the will and strength, you can follow the yellow trail to Średni Grojec.
