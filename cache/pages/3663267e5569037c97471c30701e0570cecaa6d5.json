  "text": "Easily combine multiple JPG images into a single PDF file to catalog and share with others. You can also combine images with existing PDF files. This service automatically rotates, optimizes and scales down images, but keeping the original resolution. Most people have seen a JPG (or JPEG) file before. JPGs are image files, meaning they contain a photograph, drawing, or some other piece of static visual information. JPGs are terrific for sharing digital images because they can be easily compressed to keep file sizes reasonable while still looking great on a screen. PDFs are also pretty well-known. A PDF is a document file that usually contains pages of text. It can also have hyperlinks and even images. Like JPGs, PDFs are terrific for sharing on the internet because they always look the same regardless of device. While JPG images are great, they cannot contain multiple pages of images. If, for example, you wanted to share 10 images with a friend, you would need to send them 10 separate JPGs, which might be inconvenient or even impossible, depending on the situation. PDFs, however, can contain a limitless number of pages. Each one of those pages could be a copy of a JPG image. This would allow you to share one PDF with many images, making it much easier to send to others. Converting multiple JPGs to one PDF would be perfect for a photographer who wants to share themed examples of their work. It would also be great for a designer who wants to share a few different iterations of a possible design. There are so many reasons having a PDF with a collection of JPGs would be useful! First, you'll need to upload one or up to 20 JPG files. There are no limits on file size for your JPGs, but you can only do up to 20 at one time. To upload them, drag and drop the files onto the page. On mobile devices, you can select files from your gallery. Once uploaded, our tool will process the files automatically. Before moving on, make sure your images are in the desired order. You can move the images around within the queue to fix any errors. Remember that the first image will be page one of the PDF, the second image will be page two, and on and on. When the conversion process is finished and your images are ordered correctly, you can download one combined PDF file with all the images. Alternatively, you can download each JPG as a separate single-page PDF. If you need to put more than 20 JPGs into a PDF, don't worry: we can help! First, upload all your JPGs in batches of 20, converting them to a combined PDF as you go. In the end, you'll have several PDFs with 20 pages each. Take those PDFs to our PDF combiner tool to join those PDFs together into one! Our tool is completely safe to use. You don't need to be concerned about data loss because our server uploads a copy of your original file and then uses that for the conversion process. Your original files are safe! Also, you don't need to worry about privacy and security. Our system deletes all conversions and uploads after 60 minutes. This ensures your sensitive information is kept safe."
