  "text": "Pete Davidson returned to “Saturday Night Live” for the cold open of the Jan. 31 episode, portraying border czar Tom Homan while he’s working with some woefully underprepared ICE agents in Minneapolis. Davidson opened the segment by saying, “I’m sure a lot of you are wondering why Greg Bovino, the last guy, was dismissed. I want to stress that it wasn’t because he did a bad job, or publicly lied about the shooting of an American citizen, or even, uh oh, dressed like a Nazi. It was that he was filmed doing these things, and the President no likey that. So I’m here now, and we need to tighten up. That starts with remembering the mission objective. Now, who could tell me why we’re here in Minneapolis?” Of course, the recruits had no clear answers. Popular on Variety As he continued, Davidson, as Homan, said, “Let’s talk about use of force. When do we want to use force? … It’s kind of a trick question, because we actually don’t want to use force. Remember, the job ultimately is about keeping America safe from … what?” A recruit, played by James Austin Johnson, answered, “This could be wrong, but Don Lemon?” Ultimately, Homan agreed that the key was to avoid getting videotaped doing anything illegal: “Maybe just try not to get filmed!” The episode was hosted by Alexander Skarsgård, with musical guest Cardi B. Pete Davidson launched his new Netflix video podcast “The Pete Davidson Show” on Friday, with MGK as his first guest. Watch the sketch below."
