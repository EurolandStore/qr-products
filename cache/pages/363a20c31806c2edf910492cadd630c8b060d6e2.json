  "text": "FALLOUT: CASCADIA WELCOME TO THE PACIFIC WASTELAND Fallout: Cascadia is an upcoming and expansive total conversion for Fallout 4. Explore the ruins of King County, encountering familiar groups such as the NCR, and new regional factions like the Republic of Cascadia and their opposition, the guerilla Red Leafs. Cascadia is centered around King County, Washington, including the massive ruin of Seattle itself. With a playable map that's two times the size of Fallout 4s, you'll explore swamps, isolated mountain paths, and even the Ashlands, lands permanently scarred by the eruption of Mount Rainier. Amid these ruins, you'll also find sparks and embers of civilization, whether it's the Republic of Cascadia's capital of Cascade, or the shady market of Pike's Place. From the vilest of raiders to the most civilized Cascade bureaucrat, you'll meet plenty of new people. Cascadia features many new, returning mechanics, such as an enhanced dialogue system, the return of skills and niche perks, as well as new versions of older systems such as as repair and ammo swapping. You can even choose your own background, with traits and dialogue choices to match. Cascadia is entirely volunteer created and led, with our team members ranging from industry developers to hobbyists. Whatever your background, if you feel you can contribute, we'd love to have you!"
