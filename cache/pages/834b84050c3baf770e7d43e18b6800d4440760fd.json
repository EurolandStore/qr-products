Tylaj Clark-Spencer, 21, of Howell, was sentenced Friday after pleading no contest to multiple charges stemming from the May 2025 crime that left another man dead. Clark-Spencer was sentenced to 75 months to 15 years for manslaughter, 31 months to 10 years for receiving and concealing a stolen firearm, and two years each for two charges of felony firearm. The felony firearm sentences will be served consecutively to the other sentences, meaning he could spend more than 15 years behind bars. Before he was sentenced, Clark-Spencer told the court that the shooting was an accident. Oakland County Judge Yasmine Poles noted that he has a criminal record and was on probation at the time. She told him she hopes he comes out of prison changed. The backstory: The night of May 22, 2025, an 18-year-old Troy man was shot at a Clawson home near 14 Mile and Renshaw. That victim was brought to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A witness on the scene provided information to police about two people who fled the scene - Clark-Spencer and 18-year-old Joshua Peel. Clark-Spencer and Peel, along with an unnamed 17-year-old, were all later arrested. Peel and the juvenile were both charged with accessory after the fact to a felony, while Clark-Spencer was charged with manslaughter, receiving and concealing a stolen firearm, and two counts of felony firearms. Clark-Spencer, who was scheduled to go to trial, pleaded no contest to the four charges in December. The Source: This information is from previous reporting and court records."
