  "text": "Condensation is not a process that lifts air. Condensation is when water vapor in the air turns into liquid water, typically forming clouds or fog, but it does not contribute to lifting air. Processes that lift air include orographic lifting, frontal lifting, and convergence lifting. Helicopter blades are balanced by adjusting their weight distribution to ensure that the center of mass is aligned with the rotational axis. They go through a process of dynamic balancing where weights are added or removed to minimize vibrations during flight. This process helps to improve performance and increase safety for the helicopter and passengers. The blades impart a downward impulse to the air and produce a downward change in the momentum of the air. The air at the same time exerts an upward impulse on the blades, providing lift. (Newton's third law applies to impulses as well as forces.) The efficiency of a self-locking lifting machine is typically very high, often close to 100%. This is because self-locking mechanisms prevent the load from slipping or descending unintentionally, ensuring that the lifting process is secure and stable. Regular maintenance and inspection are important to maintain this high efficiency over time. Using a lever to lift a stone provides mechanical advantage, allowing you to lift heavier loads with less effort. It also allows for precise control over the lifting process. Lastly, a lever can be easily adjusted or used in various positions to suit different lifting needs."
