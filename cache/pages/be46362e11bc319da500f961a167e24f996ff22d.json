  "text": "The latest version of the International Classification of Headaches was published in the January 2018 issue of Cephalalgia, exactly 30 years after its first edition. The Classification is a tool in the hands of experts to diagnose any painful headache disorder, be it primary or secondary. It is divided into 2 parts: the first part includes 4 chapters concerning primary headaches, the second part 8 chapters concerning all the possible secondary causes of headache and, finally, the third part concerning painful cranial neuropathies, other pains facial and other headaches. Nevertheless, starting from the second edition, the Classification has an Appendix which presents the classification criteria of new head pain entities not yet validated by an adequate number of scientific research or presents alternative diagnostic criteria for some headaches present in the main body of the Classification.
