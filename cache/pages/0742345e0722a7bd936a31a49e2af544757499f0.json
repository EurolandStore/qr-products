  "text": "Is the Home Depot appliance protection plan worth a damn? Looking at buying a new washer and dryer, and curious what my best option is for a protection plan. Is Home Depot's any good? Other suggestions for service assistance beyond the initial manufacturer warranty? EDIT - If all you have to say is \"don't buy a warranty,\" then I'm not interested in your opinion. I'd like to know whether this specific warranty will provide value if it's needed."
