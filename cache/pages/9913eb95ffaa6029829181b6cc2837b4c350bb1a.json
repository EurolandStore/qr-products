Built in 1898, it houses many treasures of great historical significance. It has six meeting halls, a research library dedicated to Freemasonry, and the administrative offices for the Grand Lodge and other Masonic bodies and programs. The building and library are open to the public; tours are available Monday through Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Oldest In The Western Hemisphere The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts dates back to 1733. It was the first in the New World, and the third oldest following the Grand Lodges of England and Ireland. Formally organized under the leadership of Henry Price, Boston’s first Masons met at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern. Freemasons have been building better men and better communities ever since."
