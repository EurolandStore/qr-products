Restricted States Alabama, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, Nevada, Washington Company SpinPals LLC owns and operates SpinPals since 2024. Support - Live chat - Social media messaging - FAQ IS SPINPALS WORTH CHECKING OUT? Alright, let’s get real about SpinPals, the good, the bad, and the frustrating. I spent quite a bit of time testing this social sweepstakes casino, and I have some strong opinions. If you’re considering giving it a shot, here’s my full take, including what works and what had me rolling my eyes. Restricted States & Age Requirements First off, if you’re in Alabama, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, or Washington, sorry, you’re out of luck. SpinPals doesn’t let players from these states sign up. For the rest of us? You can jump in as long as you’re 18+ (or whatever the legal age is in your state). Canadian players can also play, except for those in Quebec. Sign-Up Bonus & Ways to Earn More The welcome bonus is actually pretty sweet, you get 30,000 Gold Coins and 3 Sweeps Coins just for signing up. No deposit needed. Beyond that, SpinPals has a few different ways to get free SCs: Daily Wheel Spins where you can win up to 3.1 SCs per week. Social Media Contests: They run giveaways on Facebook, but I’ve entered a few and, surprise surprise, never won. Refer-a-Friend Bonus: If your buddy signs up and makes a $10 purchase, you get 100,000 Gold Coins + 10 SCs. Mail-in Requests: Yeah, if you actually send a letter, they’ll give you 3 free SCs. It’s free, but honestly, who has the patience to mail in requests anymore? My biggest issue? After the welcome bonus, there aren’t a ton of exciting promos. They could really step up their game by offering more regular rewards, like deposit matches or leaderboard challenges. Gold Coins vs. Sweeps Coins: What’s the Difference? Like most sweepstakes casinos, SpinPals has two currencies: Gold Coins (GC): Used for playing just for fun. You can buy these, but they have no real-world value. Sweeps Coins (SC): These are the only coins you can redeem for real prizes (cash or gift cards). Earning SC is kind of a grind. You either buy a Gold Coin package that includes free SCs, win them from contests, or send those old-school mail requests. Slots, Tables & More: Exploring SpinPals’ Games Initially, I thought SpinPals was predominantly slot-focused. However, upon further exploration, I discovered a more diverse game library: Slots: Over 250 slot games from providers like Habanero, Hacksaw Gaming, and BGaming. Table and Card Games: 20 options including blackjack and poker. Live Dealer Games: A variety of live dealer games provided by ICONIC21, offering an immersive experience. Arcade Games: A variety of arcade-style games for a different gaming experience. Scratch Cards: Multiple scratch card games for quick wins. This variety caters to a broader range of players than I initially realized. How Payments and Redemptions Work SpinPals lets you buy Gold Coins with: - Visa & Mastercard - Amex - Apple Pay For Redemptions: - Online Bank Transfer (2-5 days) Now, onto redemptions (where things get dicey). You can cash out SCs for real money or gift cards. Minimum redemption is $100 worth of SCs (which is way too high, in my opinion). They say it takes 2-5 business days, but I’ve seen reports of it taking longer. I personally haven’t had any withdrawal issues, but I know people who have waited weeks for their cashouts. That’s a big red flag for me. If they can tighten up their payout speed, it would make a huge difference. SpinPals Mobile & Desktop Experience: Smooth or Slow? As for the website, it works fine, easy to navigate. Nothing groundbreaking. Mobile Access: While SpinPals doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app, it is fully accessible via your mobile browser. I played on my phone a fair bit, and it ran smoothly without any major hiccups. However, the absence of a native app (especially for iOS users) is definitely a downside. I’d love to see them release an app in the future for a more seamless experience. Getting Assistance: SpinPals Support Experience When it comes to support at SpinPals, here’s what you’ve got: Live Chat: Yes, they offer live chat, which is a great feature for quick questions and support. FAQ Page: There’s a solid Help Center with an FAQ section that can answer a lot of the basic queries. Other Contact Options: You can also reach out via social media messaging if that’s your preferred method. Phone Support: Not available, so if you prefer to talk things out over the phone, you’re out of luck. Response Time: The good news is that response times are relatively quick, typically between 30 to 60 minutes, which is way better than waiting days for an email response. While the live chat option is a big plus, the lack of phone support might still be a dealbreaker for some. However, the quick response times and social media contact options do help make up for it. Is SpinPals Compliant with US Laws? Yes! SpinPals is a legit sweepstakes casino and follows the standard sweepstakes model. You don’t “gamble” with real money, which lets them operate in most states without a casino license. That said, some states (like New York) are considering banning sweepstakes casinos. So if you’re in a legal state now, keep an eye on the rules because things could change. Final Verdict on SpinPals SpinPals offers a solid gaming experience with a great mix of slots, table games, and live dealers. The welcome bonus is generous, but the $100 redemption minimum for Sweeps Coins is pretty high. While the website and mobile browser experience are smooth, the lack of an iOS app is a letdown. Customer support is mostly live chat with quick response times, but no phone support can be limiting. As for legality, SpinPals is legal in most states, though that could change in the future, so always check local laws. It’s a fun platform, but improvements in payout speed and more regular promotions could make it even better. I'd give this casino a final rating of 7/10.
