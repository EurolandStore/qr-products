  "title": "vocabulary - Hat-trick is for three, what's the word for four consecutive successes? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange",
  "text": "The term \"hat trick\" originated in the sport of cricket in the mid-1800s, referring to a bowler taking three wickets with three consecutive deliveries. The achievement was traditionally rewarded with a hat, leading to the term's name. The phrase later spread to other sports like hockey and soccer for three goals in a game, and now has a more general meaning for any string of three successes. I wonder if there is any specific word something occuring successfully four times (consecutively). Such as flipping a coin and getting \"Heads, Heads, Heads, Heads\" in four straight flips. Or before match, a captain wins the toss fourth time (consecutively). That team won the toss for the fourth time in four consecutive matches. Taking into consideration the previous question asked in EL&SE: Is there a word for four times as much, analogous to once, twice, and thrice? This particular question is asking for a word that denotes something occuring four times (but not consecutively). Interestingly, most of the answers haven't suggested any word for that in this question as that looks non-existent. The word I am looking for is about \"Four consecutive successes\" that refer to achieving a successful outcome in four trials or events that occur one immediately after another, without any failures or interruptions in between. The term haul is specifically used in English-speaking soccer communities. It is not a generalised term like hat-trick that spread from cricket and now widely used across all conditions."
