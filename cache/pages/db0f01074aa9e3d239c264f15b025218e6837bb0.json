  "text": "Eric Johnson - Flag inappropriate - Show review history This is clearly a great game, but personally I do not like to constantly worry about being ambushed and hit upside the head while I explore. Also, am I a naked, one-armed man? Because if I can only ever carry one single item at a time... 😐 Jokes aside, though, this has to lose a star for randomly resetting when you leave the app, erasing all your progress. 884 people found this review helpful Kyle “Autistic” Day So I've played all 3 chapters and enjoyed all 3, (especially the first one. I also hope to see more.) but I've recently fell into a bug where when if she catches me abt the 3rd or 4th time I get an ad (expected.) But am able to skip it, but afterwards I cannot get back to the game, it just stays there frozen on the install screen, and then I end up losing my progress. Plz help 243 people found this review helpful Bentley Streeval - Flag inappropriate - Show review history A classic of all horror games. Very good horror game. Graphics are good, the gameplay is nice! I would love to rate this more than just 5 stars. Edit: There is a problem where after I get caught by granny, the game refuses to take me to the next day and the game just freezes. Does anybody else experience this as well? Please do something about this bug. 631 people found this review helpful"
