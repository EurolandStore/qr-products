  "title": "Decoding facebook's blob video url - Stack Overflow",
  "text": "Another alternative that worked in Firefox in Feb 2021: - Open the post's permalink - Change the page's URL - replace www with m and load that - Now use Inspector to navigate down to the div containing the video object - and the video URL will be a direct link - Copy-paste that URL into your browser, or create an anchor link to that URL and load your link and right-click to save destination. It downloads as mp4 including video and audio. Update, 2 Jul 2021 When I followed my own steps today, pasting the mp4 URL returned a page giving the following error: Bad URL timestamp However, I still found a work-around. Side note: One of the containing divs has ID mobile_injected_video_feed_pagelet . Facebook now injects the video element when you hit the play button. That VIDEO element contains the URL you need. The URL does contain \"MP4\" in the path. What I did was: - Open Inspector - Hit \"Play\" on the video - While the video is playing, find the VIDEO element and copy the URL from the VIDEO element - Paste that into a new tab - The new tab would show a smaller thumbnail of the video - Right-click the thumbnail and save the media to your PC You must hit play for the VIDEO element to appear in the page source. I'm using Firefox but any browser with an inspector should work."
