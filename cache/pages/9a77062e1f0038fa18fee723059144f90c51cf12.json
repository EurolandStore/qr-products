  "text": "When designing a kitchen, here are some tips to help guide you to get the most of your new layout: Arrange sink, stove, and fridge in an efficient triangle if possible. Think about creating zones for prep, cooking, cleaning, and serving. If possible, reserve counter space near the stove and sink as work areas. When creating your design consider placing your sink first, then add the stove and refrigerator if utility hook ups allow you to move them."
