  "text": "Produce Department Our Produce department is a sight to behold, from stacks of crisp organic apples to rows of juicy Sourced for Good pineapples, but that’s just the beginning. We’re the first (and only) certified organic national grocer. Our field inspectors visit farms to select the best-tasting fruits and vegetables at peak season. And we're proud to feature produce from local farmers in our stores. What makes our produce different? We're the first certified organic national grocery store. Earning certification isn’t easy, but it’s worth it. We ensure that organic produce stays organic from the farm to the shelf. We support workers, communities and the environment. Our Sourced for Good fruits and veggies support workers, communities and environmental stewardship. Look for the seal throughout our Produce department."
