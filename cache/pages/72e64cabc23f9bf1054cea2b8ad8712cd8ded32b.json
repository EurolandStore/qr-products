This fundraiser will soon be over, but we haven't yet hit our goal. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75. After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promisedâcreated by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire. Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps. 25 years of the internet at its best Sorry to interrupt, but we're short on time to hit our goal. Today, we ask you to join the 2% of readers who give. If everyone reading this right now gave just $2.75, we'd hit our goal quickly. $2.75 is all we ask. â The Wikimedia Foundation, host of Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects."
