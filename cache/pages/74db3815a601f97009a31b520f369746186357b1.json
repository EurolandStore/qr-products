  "text": "Hey so if you have emailed me about barrels through the forum, sorry, but I haven't been getting any. I just had someone email me directly about a barrel and he said he had previously tried to reach me. Something was jacked up with my email or something. Barrels are in- I have the 20\" Model 336(ARM/AR) barrels, and the 16\" Model 329 (SAR) barrels. These are dimensional copies taken off multiple IMI guns for reference. They are short-chambered by ~.025\" so you can finish reamer the chamber perfectly when you've fitted your bolt correctly. You can rent a reamer for relatively cheap from a few places(I think around $15/3 days), or I can provide this service for an additional $125. I'll just need you to send in your receiver and bolt, and you'll get back a barreled receiver, lugs lapped correctly and headspaced to your specifications. If you need the bullet guide fit correctly I can do this for you as well. Barrels are $350 for the ARM, and $325 for the SAR. Please email me directly, as I don't check the forum too often. As soon as I figure out how to post pictures, I will post some for those interested."
