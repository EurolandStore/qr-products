  "text": "From OurFamily to Yours The Toufayan family’s been baking breads with quality and care since 1926, the year we opened our first bakery. Still family owned today, we’re one of the largest, privately-held specialty bakeries in the United States, filling lunch bags, toasters and tummies with our delicious flatbreads, pitas, bagels and snack-time yummies. Toufayan Bakeries produces over 100 varieties of baked goods daily, including product options and innovations created to meet a variety of specific consumer needs, such as Smart Pockets and Gluten Free Wraps. From our Corporate Headquarters and Pita plant in Ridgefield, NJ, to our two bakeries in Orlando and Plant City, FL, the third generation of Toufayans still carefully oversees every step of the manufacturing process, from ingredient sourcing, production and baking to packaging and distribution. Families have been relyin’ on the great taste of Toufayan for generations. Enjoy! From our family to yours. –The Toufayans."
