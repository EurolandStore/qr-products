  "text": "I've have received equally strong YES and HELL NO to shooting 5.56 out of a Galil. My new to me Galil is an Action Arms pre-ban import circa 1986 or so with a 1-in-12 twist and stamped .223. Jeff Miller of Tenngalil fame says, GO FOR IT, others also knowledgeable say NOPE, could be risky given higher pressures shooting 5.56. Why risk your pre-ban Galil? Which is a good point when .223 is available and getting cheaper by the week/month. So, I've been sticking to .223 in 55 grain. I have watched enough videos and enough reviews to be convinced the 1-in-12 twist will not preform well (consistently/accurately) for bullet weights above 55gr, so that eliminates much modern 5.56 anyhow. Please chime in and ideally, cite your sources. So, I've been sticking to .223 in 55 grain.
