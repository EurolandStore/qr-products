  "text": "Noelle vs Mimosa.. who will asta end up with? There's multiple angles to this question. If you go by who deserves to end up with asta, it's Mimosa no doubt. She pretty much always liked him, and was never ashamed of it (her only fault in that regard was never telling him directly.) But her biggest flaws are.. she isn't a mc, and she was fairly developed all along. I think inevitably asta will end up with Noelle. The story has developed her, using him as a catalyst. AND unlike every other female that's basically simped over asta, asta has actually stated that he \"likes her Alot\".. tbh I think the issue now would be what to do with Mimosa when Noelle and asta finally get together."
