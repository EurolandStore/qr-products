  "text": "I double checked this. The SARs imported by Mossberg were registered full autos, but they still had the double-flash hider (I'm assuming so they wouldn't count as SBRs when imported). I did make a mistake and forgot to include the 13\" barrels for 5.56 and 16\" barrels for 7.62 and barrel pinned lugs. I also unfortunately left out in the SAR section that the gas tube and piston were trimmed down. Does anyone have the measurements of the SAR Gas tube and piston? SAR Gas piston: 4.33 inches SAR Gas Tube : 7.675 inches SAR 5.56 barrel: 13.1 inches SAR 7.62 barrel: 15.7 inches Do you mean Magnum Research or Mossberg (when they were contracting with UZI America)? My neighbor down the street; has a Action Arms imported machine gun in the 13\" barrel configuration (I'll get a picture of it) SAR Pics: Someone I know; Their imported Magnum Research machine gun SAR (also with the pinned bayonet lug). He also swaped out the bolt carrier. with a custom horizontal charging handle (Kind've like a Haddar, but made by IMI for Galil's) A picture of my R5 done by Tenngalil before it got redone into a more proper configuration; with the pinned bayonet lug (Now without it;as R5's should be). Good Job on the work and finally posting it:beer"
