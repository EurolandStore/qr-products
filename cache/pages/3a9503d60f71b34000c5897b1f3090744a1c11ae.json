  "text": "Kerrygolds is overrated? Bought a big thing from Costco thinking it would be great I've heard so much about it. I used it for cooking, searing, baking, even just putting it straight on bread. Tbh I don't like it at all, we're going back to using store brand butter. I gave it an honest shot but I don't get the appeal. It's just overpriced and kinda nasty lol. Anyone else think that kerrygolds is overrated?"
