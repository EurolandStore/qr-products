  "title": "python 3.x - Anaconda Navigator is not running after updating - Stack Overflow",
  "text": "I am a beginner in the world of Python and am using Anaconda for learning. I am Using Windows 11. I downloaded the Windows installer, Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Windows-x86_64.exe’. The Anaconda Navigator initially opened correctly, but since not all packages were updated, I closed it. I then opened the Anaconda Prompt and ran the command ‘conda update –all’. The process finished successfully. I closed the Prompt, but the Navigator no longer opens. I have consulted many resources for a solution. The approach that most closely reflects the steps I have taken is the one described in the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f41Uk8kAglE. I followed these steps using the Anaconda Prompt: - Updated conda: I ran ‘conda update conda’. The update ran properly, with no error message. The Navigator still did not open. - Updated Anaconda Navigator: I ran ‘conda update anaconda-navigator’. The update ran properly, with no error message. The Navigator still did not open. - Updated conda in the root environment: I executed ‘conda update -n root conda’ and then repeated ‘conda update conda’. It did not work. - Final attempt: As a last resort, I tried to open the Anaconda Prompt and execute the command anaconda-navigator. When I did this, I received the error message shown in the picture below. Please help me. I would appreciate any suggestion."
