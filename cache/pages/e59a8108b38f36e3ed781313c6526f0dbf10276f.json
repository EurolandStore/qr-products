I use it as a primary resource when choosing my classes but I've had profs that people said were bad that I personally really enjoyed and I've also had profs that people said were great that I avoid like the plague, in your experience how accurate does RMP tend to be? because after 3 and a half years I still use it but I tend to take it with a grain of salt"
