  "text": "Andy breaks down the barrier between desktop and mobile computing, while keeping a user up to date with the latest Android OS feature upgrades. It also provides users with unlimited storage capacity, PC and Mac compatibility, and the freedom to play the most popular mobile games on a desktop, Yes you can now run Android on windows. With phone as a joystick, you will never have to sacrifice the multi-touch or gyro elements of gaming, and thanks to seamless connection between desktop and mobile, you can receive a SnapChat phone picture on the street and see it on your desktop at home or even a whatsapp message. For much of 2011 and into early 2012 the founders of Andy thought and talked a great deal about what would be a truly compelling product for the person of today, the person who uses multiple mobile devices and spends many hours at work and home on a desktop. With a cluttered mobile app market and minimal app innovation for the desktop, the discussion kept coming back to the OS as a central point for all computing, and how the OS itself could be transformational. And from that conclusion Andy was born. The open OS that became Andy would allow developers and users to enjoy more robust apps, to experience them in multiple device environments, and to stop being constrained by the limits of device storage, screen size or separate OS. – To better connect the PC and Mobile computing experience – At Andy we strive to create a stronger connection between a person’s mobile and desktop life. We believe you should always have the latest Android OS running without the necessity of a manual update, that you should be able to download an app on your PC and automatically have access to it on your phone or tablet, and that you should be able to play your favorite games whether sitting on the train to work or in the comfort of your living room"
