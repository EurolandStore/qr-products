  "text": "Alibaba's Adjusted EBITA Missed on Higher Quick Commerce Loss And Foundational Model Costs Alibaba is losing market share to PDD and Douyin in the China e-commerce business, and we don't see a quick fix in the near term. Alibaba's number of annual active consumers in the China retail marketplace was surpassed by PDD in the fiscal year ended March 2021. Meanwhile, Douyin has gained share from Alibaba, especially in the beauty and apparel categories in recent years, and entered the traditional search-based e-commerce space, competing directly with Alibaba. The number of annual active consumers at Alibaba is close to the ceiling in China. Alibaba's gross merchandise volume to China's online retail sales of goods ratio was 62% in the year ended March 2023 at Alibaba, down from 72% in the year-ago period. We believe Alibaba's marketplace monetization rates will decline in the long run, due to a mix shift toward Taobao, which has a lower take rate compared with Tmall, and more competition."
