There are two walking trails available (1-2 hours), and both combine the pleasure of hiking with the discovery of industrial heritage. Hyères Islands This is the best place to visit in Provence for a relaxing vacation by the sea. The Hyères Islands are a group of French islands off the town of Hyères in the Var department of Southeastern France, consisting of three main islands (Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and Ile du Levant) and one smaller one. Transportation to the three biggest islands is limited, and the smallest island, Île du Bagaud, does not allow visitors. The island of Porquerolles is the most popular, with beautiful turquoise water, sandy beaches, a sleepy little village, and several wineries. Port-Cros is mountainous and home to a bird refuge and rare flora. If you have the time, then you can also explore Île du Levant, with its naturist community and privately owned village. With less time available, rent a boat in Hyères town, with or without a skipper, and sail around the islands on a day trip. Avignon Avignon is on the left bank of the Rhône River. One of the most beautiful walled cities in France, Avignon was the seat of the Catholic Popes from 1309 to 1377. Avignon is most famous for its medieval Old Town and the Palais des Papes, Europe’s largest Gothic Palace and one of the most interesting places to visit in Provence. The Palais des Papes is a UNESCO-listed palace built in the 14th century, when the papal court relocated from Rome to Avignon. The town of Avignon is filled with museums, such as the Musée du Petit Palais, which features artwork by Sandro Botticelli and Vittore Carpaccio.

Roman Provence Provence is a region whose culture and charm have been influenced by thousands of years of history. Provence sounds like “province”. That’s because it was the first Roman province outside of what is now Italy, and the Romans called it “Provencia Romana.” Under the Roman administration, the region’s economic and artistic life flourished. The towns of Orange, Arles, Nimes, Orange, Vaison la Romaine, and Fréjus are the best places in Provence to see Roman vestiges in the region, like magnificent remains of arenas, amphitheaters, spas, and villas. There’s also Glanum, the most complete ancient archeological complex in France, located outside Saint-Rémy.
