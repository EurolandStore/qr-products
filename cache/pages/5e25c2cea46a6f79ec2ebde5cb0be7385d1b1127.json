For Magiblade is it now the Sandstar Meatroll? I usually find this question odd, but Which server is European anyway? I started playing on the recommended server, but at first I couldn't even complete the tutorial or create a character. The connection to the server would consistently drop every 8-10 seconds, only to be reestablished. Then I also saw a message in the in-game store saying \"unable to retrieve item information\" quite regularly. And finally, I noticed significant lag in the city. It felt like the server I created my character on was on the other side of the world. But when I tried creating a character on another server, I couldn't figure out which server I needed to go to. I'm not even sure I can see European servers. Can anyone help?"
