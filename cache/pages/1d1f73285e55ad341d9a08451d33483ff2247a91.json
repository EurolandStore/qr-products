  "text": "DAVID MARTINEZ THEORY [MASSIVE SPOILERS] I really know I want to belive he's still alive, I just finished the series and i'm both really happy for Lucy but really depressed about Davd,the implcations of cyberpunk 2077's endings leaves us off with all the same outcome for David except the corpo ending. In every other ending besides the corpo one, it ends up being the case that Alt sucks up all the souls into her. If it was the case that David was actually turned into a construct, basically in every ending (but the corpo one), it leaves David's consciousness to get shredded into Alt, and V is indirectly responsible for it. Man I hate the corpo ending, but now I feel like doing the corpo ending just for the chance that david might still be left alive. (That's just assuming he wasn't killed on the spot by Adam smasher) (The only reason he might have survived, well I mean Johnny Silverhand got a projectile launch system straight to the face as well, before becoming a construct, this also assumes Adam holds onto the best and only useful rounds in the game, {Tranqulizer round}."
