ConsumerShield is transforming the way consumers experience law. What Is Roundup, and Why Is It Dangerous? Roundup was once one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Its primary active ingredient, glyphosate, blocks an enzyme necessary for protein creation and thus plant growth as well. When sprayed on fields, genetically modified crops resist glyphosate, whereas weeds quickly shrivel and die. However, glyphosate usage allegedly disrupts the endocrine system controlling the hormones that activate and deactivate cell growth. As a result, users can develop cancers such as: - Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma - Leukemia - Multiple myeloma - Lung cancer - Pancreatic cancer In many cases, these cancers will require chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Many affected users will die despite receiving extensive medical care. How Does a Roundup Lawsuit Work? Injured users can file a Roundup lawsuit against Bayer in state or federal court. Federal cases will be transferred to the Northern District of California for consolidation with the Roundup multidistrict litigation (MDL). State court cases will remain in the jurisdiction where they were filed. These cases claim that Monsanto failed to warn users about Roundup’s dangers. They also allege that the company didn’t instruct people applying the herbicide to wear PPE like hazard suits and respirators. Under product liability law in most states, manufacturers are strictly liable for dangerously defective products. These warning defects could force Bayer to pay for the injuries Monsanto’s products have caused. Free Roundup Lawsuit Case Review Preparing Case Review Form.

Product liability attorneys typically charge a contingency fee based on the jury award or settlement you receive. Specifically, you pay a percentage of the compensation your lawyer recovers as a legal fee. The percentage varies by individual lawyer. However, a typical contingency fee falls between 33% and 40%. Additionally, if your case was transferred to the MDL court, you may also need to pay the MDL lead counsel who performed work on behalf of all plaintiffs. Settlement Amounts in Roundup Lawsuits A Roundup settlement could happen in two ways. First, Bayer paid over $10 billion to establish a settlement fund to resolve Roundup cases. To claim a portion of this settlement, you and your attorney must submit documentation describing your medical conditions and the link to Roundup. Second, you can file a lawsuit against Bayer. The company is still fighting thousands of Roundup cases. In many situations, plaintiffs choose to litigate instead of applying for a settlement because they believe they can get more from a jury than the settlement fund. In either situation, your compensation will depend on many factors, including the type of cancer, your prognosis and your age. A young person with a terminal prognosis will typically receive the largest payout. Free Roundup Lawsuit Case Review Preparing Case Review Form.
