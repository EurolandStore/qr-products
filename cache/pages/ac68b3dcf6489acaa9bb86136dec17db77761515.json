  "text": "- Blackbeard Powers should destroy the entire thing rather than breaking in thr middle. - burgess is strong, but throwing things is the best he could do underwater. - Van Auger is a good option given how explosive his attacks can get once Haki is involved. Saber of Xebec, though a ship, shouldn't be able to destroy a submarime underwater. Kidd ship was destroyed by Dorry and Broggy."
