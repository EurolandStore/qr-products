There are five officially recognized dwarf planets in our solar system: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. Planets Dwarf Planets Introduction What is a planet? The word traces back to the ancient Greek word planēt, which means “wanderer.” A more modern definition can be found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which defines a planet as “any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system.” In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) — a group of astronomers that names objects in our solar system — agreed on their own definition of “planet.” This new definition caused Pluto's famous “demotion” to a dwarf planet, and reduced the solar system census from nine planets to eight. Inner Planets The first four planets from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These inner planets also are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces. Mercury Facts Mercury is the planet nearest to the Sun, and the smallest planet in our solar system. Earth Facts Earth – our home planet – is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest planet. Outer Planets The giant planets in the outer solar system don't have hard surfaces. Instead, they have swirling gases above a core. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter Facts Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and the largest planet in our solar system. Saturn Facts Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, the second largest planet in our solar system. Uranus Facts Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third largest planet in our solar system. Neptune Facts Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. It's the fourth largest planet. Dwarf Planets Dwarf planets include longtime favorite Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris. Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. It's in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres Facts Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it's the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Pluto Facts Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. It was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union. Haumea Facts Haumea was nicknamed Santa by one discovery team. It is oval-shaped, and is one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system. Makemake Facts Makemake is slightly smaller than Pluto, and is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt, while Pluto is the brightest. Eris Facts The discovery of Eris helped trigger the debate in the scientific community that led to the decision to clarify the definition of a planet.
