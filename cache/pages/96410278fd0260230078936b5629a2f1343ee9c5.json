  "text": "Under President Donald Trump’s second administration, the United States has surged into a new era of prosperity, marked by record-setting economic growth and trillions in new private-sector investments fueled by tax reforms, deregulation, and a renewed focus on American innovation. The nation has solidified its position as the global leader in artificial intelligence, with record-setting capital expenditures driving productivity and technological advancement. At home, decisive policies have secured the southern border, reducing illegal entries to historic lows unseen in decades and restoring national sovereignty, while energy dominance and cost-cutting measures have significantly improved affordability for families. Abroad, a doctrine of peace through strength has secured alliances, ended eight wars, and positioned America as an indispensable force for global stability. As these achievements compound, we have unmistakably entered a Golden Age of American greatness, promising even greater opportunity and security ahead. Donald J. Trump 45th & 47th President of the United States"
