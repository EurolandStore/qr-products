  "text": "I received my Tech license recently and it is updated in the FCC database and I am now trying to sign up for the QRZ jumpstart program. Everything on QRZ says that I'm not registered as a ham member so should I just wait for the QRZ database to update or do I need to do something? Congratulations on your newly acquired license. It takes 24-48 hours, sometimes longer after the license is issued for the license to sync with QRZ and this hasn't happened yet. Prior to synchronization, QRZ doesn't recognize the license and believes it may be foreign because it's not in the database. The sync happens automatically and as soon as it does, you'll have full use of the site and will be able to apply for the jumpstart program. You will be able to tell the sync has happened when you can search for your callsign on the site and it returns your information. Once you can search your license on the site, it will be necessary to log out and back in again to update your site permissions. 73 Steve KF8KI Your callsign is now in the database. You need to logout and then log back in and you should have full access to the site and the jumpstart program."
