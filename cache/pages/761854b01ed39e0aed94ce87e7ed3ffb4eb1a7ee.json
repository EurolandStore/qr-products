  "text": "We are entering a transformative era in juvenile myositis research — and you can be part of it. By joining Walk Strong, you’ll make lifelong connections with Cure JM families and help keep research momentum going. It’s free to register, but every dollar you raise fuels real hope. The funds you raise will fuel groundbreaking research for better treatments - including JAK inhibitors which are at the forefront of a treatment revolution to reduce the need for harsh treatments. Cure JM is also leading the way with a promising new immune system “reset” called CAR-T therapy — all aimed at giving kids more hope for a \"one and done\" treatment that could spare kids years of difficult, harsh medications. These incredible breakthroughs are happening because of generous supporters like you. Your support will also help expand Cure JM’s Clinical Care Network, ensuring children can access expert care close to home without needing to travel across the country for specialized treatment. Walk Your Way: - These are community events, so bring the whole family! Walk portions are short and often stroller friendly. - Not interested in walking? No problem. Come that day to enjoy the entertainment and fun! - Join a local Walk Strong event in your area here - Or, gather your friends and family and walk wherever you are — your neighborhood, a park, even your treadmill! - Contact a walk manager in your region for help.
