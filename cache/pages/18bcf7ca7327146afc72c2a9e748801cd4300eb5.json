  "text": "Our product range includes a variety of suction cups with various shapes, sizes and materials, providing the right suction cup for every application. Suction cups consist of a elastomer part and a connection nipple. Special grippers can be used for applications in which regular suction cups cannot generate a vacuum. Schmalz offers a variety of special grippers with various shapes, sizes and principles of operation. Vacuum generators provide the required vacuum. The vacuum is generated either pneumatically (ejectors) or electrically (pumps, blowers). Ejectors offer intelligent functions for energy and process control. Valves are used to control the vacuum as well as the compressed air. The right valves can increase both the process reliability and the cost-effectiveness of the vacuum system. Devices for system monitoring are crucial to ensure the safe operation of a vacuum system. Schmalz offers a wide range of switches, measuring and control devices, as well as warning devices Filters protect the vacuum generator from contamination. Vacuum distributors, hose lines and connections complete the vacuum system and connect suction cups to vacuum generators. Digital solutions from Schmalz help to fully exploit the potential of intelligent components, especially IO-Link devices. They can be used from commissioning to operation to service."
