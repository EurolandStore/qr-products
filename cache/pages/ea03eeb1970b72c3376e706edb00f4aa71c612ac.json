  "text": "Tenute Silvio Nardi Brunello di Montalcino 2020 Winemaker Notes: Ruby red color with intense, complex aromas at the nose, rich in ripe fruits, spices and toasted notes. Enjoy with seasoned cheese and game meat. James Suckling - js93 Cherry, dark-mushroom, bark and orange-peel aromas follow through to a medium body with firm tannins and a chewy finish. Needs time to soften and develop palate complexity. Try after 2028. Wine Spectator - ws93 Rich and polished, featuring cherry, strawberry, earth, sanguine and tobacco flavors underscored by a wave of impenetrable tannins. Nonetheless, this red is not overly astringent, and there's a lasting impression of ripe fruit. Just needs time. Best from 2028 through 2045. 10,000 cases made, 1,500 cases imported. Wine Advocate - wa93 This Brunello boasts an open-knit style with textured tannins and lots of dark fruit at its core. With an ample 120,000 bottles made, the Tenute Silvio Nardi 2020 Brunello di Montalcino is a medium to full-bodied Sangiovese with a combination of dried blackberry flavors and sweetly toasted oak. Jeb Dunnuck - jd93 Pouring a dark red color, the 2020 Brunello Di Montalcino is sappy and ripe with aromas of baked blackberries, lavender, balsamic herbs, chewing tobacco, and forest floor. A lush, full-bodied wine with velvety tannins, a coating, rich texture, a well-balanced feel, and polished oak spice through the finish, it offers good length and should continue to improve over the coming 10-12 years."
