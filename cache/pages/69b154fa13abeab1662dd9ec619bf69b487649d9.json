  "text": "Tiffany Lammers - Flag inappropriate - Show review history It's 1/1/25 today, & I'm still posting stuff from my Euro trip in August, because the app crashes just as I'm about to post. 5-10 tries for it to finally go through, & the result is disappointing. I choose mixed orientations, & somehow pictures come out cropped in nonsensical ways on my feed. Some are blurry, when they shouldn't be. Stories are a wild card. Some zoomed in, some not, and no matter what I do, they don't pop up in chronological order. Forced to fix it manually. WHAT IS GOING ON? 12,616 people found this review helpful Mario Coreas First, they took down my account for sharing content that's not allowed ( I never share anything ). To make an appeal, I have to give my number, which somehow they can't find. There is no other option to reactivate my account and this has happened to a few other friends too, so it really is the app being dumb. If anyone else has this problem, just hit the 1 star review so they can't take them out of Play store :) 6,679 people found this review helpful Logan Chesley The new update is so buggy. Let's say I am going to post 5 photos, and I select to zoom them out so they aren't so close to my face. I can only zoom out one, and if I select more than 1 photo, it unzooms all of them. It has never done this before. The comments and notifications are weird as well. They glitch out, and when I go to click on the notification in the app, it doesn't let me, or it takes multiple times for it to work and bring me to where I need to be. Hope they fix this soon. 8,974 people found this review helpful"
