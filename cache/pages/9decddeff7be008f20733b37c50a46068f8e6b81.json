  "text": "Euro foreign exchange reference rates When Bulgaria adopts the euro on 1 January 2026, the Bulgarian lev will cease to be the official currency of Bulgaria and will be removed from the ECB's list of euro foreign exchange reference rates. For further details, including the official conversion rate (which is published with five decimal places, unlike the ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rates that are published with four decimal places), please refer to the ECB press release \"Bulgaria to join euro area on 1 January 2026\", dated 8 July 2025. The reference rates are usually updated at around 16:00 CET every working day, except on TARGET closing days. They are based on the daily concertation procedure between central banks across Europe, which normally takes place around 14:10 CET. The reference rates are published for information purposes only. Using the rates for transaction purposes is strongly discouraged. 4 February 2026 All currencies quoted against the euro (base currency) Owing to current trading activity in the EUR/RUB market, the European Central Bank (ECB) is not in a position to set a reference rate that is representative of prevailing market conditions. The ECB has therefore decided to suspend its publication of a euro reference rate for the Russian rouble until further notice. The ECB last published a EUR/RUB reference rate on 1 March 2022.
