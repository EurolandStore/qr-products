  "text": "Janeane Garofalo Janeane Garofalo (/dʒəˈniːn ɡəˈrɒfəloʊ/ jə-NEEN gə-ROF-əl-oh; born September 28, 1964[1]) is an American comedian and actress. The accolades she has received include nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Garofalo began her career as a stand-up comedian and became a cast member on The Ben Stiller Show, The Larry Sanders Show, and Saturday Night Live, then appeared in more than 50 movies, with leading or major roles in The Truth About Cats & Dogs, Wet Hot American Summer, The Matchmaker, Reality Bites, The Wild, Steal This Movie!, Clay Pigeons, Sweethearts, Mystery Men, The Minus Man, The Independent, Ratatouille, and Flora & Ulysses. She has appeared on television programs such as The West Wing, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, 24, Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce, and Ideal. She was the co-host on Air America Radio's The Majority Report from March 2004 until July 2006. Early life [edit]Garofalo was born in Newton, New Jersey, the daughter of Joan and Carmine Garofalo. Her mother, a secretary in the petrochemical industry, died of cancer when Janeane was 24; her father is a former Exxon executive.[2][3] Garofalo is of Italian descent.[4] She grew up in various places, including: Ontario, California; Madison, New Jersey, where she attended Madison High School;[5] and Houston, Texas, where she graduated from James E. Taylor High School.[2][3] Garofalo has said that she disliked life in Houston because of the heat and humidity and the emphasis on prettiness and sports in high school.[2][3] While studying history at Providence College, Garofalo entered a comedy talent search sponsored by the Showtime cable network, and won the title of \"Funniest Person in Rhode Island.\" Dreaming of earning a slot on the writing staff of the TV show Late Night with David Letterman, she became a professional standup comic upon graduating from college with degrees in history and American studies.[6] She struggled to make a living for a number of years, even working briefly as a bike messenger in Boston.[7] Entertainment career [edit]Stand-up comedy [edit]Garofalo began her comedy career in the mid-1980s. Her comedy is often self-deprecating; she has made fun of popular culture and the pressures on women to conform to body image ideals promoted by the media. When in San Francisco, Garofalo was a frequent guest at the San Francisco Comedy Condo.[citation needed] Garofalo's comedy shows involve her and her notebook, which is filled with years' worth of article clippings and random observations she references for direct quotes during her act. Garofalo has said that she does not tell jokes as much as make observations designed to get laughs. Upon arriving in LA in the early 1990s, she had difficulty being passed at the mainstream clubs, and when she was passed at The Improv, she often bombed. She was a pioneer of the alternative comedy scene in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, starting the alt-show at Big & Tall Books in LA on August 6, 1991.[8] Garofalo co-created the \"Eating It\" alternative stand-up comedy show, which ran at Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side of New York City between 1995 and 2005, frequently hosting the show and appearing as a performer. She appeared on HBO's Comedy Half-Hour and Comedy Hour specials in 1995 and 1997, respectively, among similar subsequent appearances, including a one-hour stand-up special entitled If I May, performed at Seattle's Moore Theatre that aired on Epix in June 2010 and was released on DVD in September 2010.[9] Film career [edit]Garofalo has performed a variety of roles in more than 50 feature films, playing leading or large roles in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, The Truth About Cats & Dogs, I Shot a Man in Vegas, The Matchmaker, Clay Pigeons, Steal This Movie!, Sweethearts, Mystery Men, The Independent, Wet Hot American Summer, Manhood, Ash Tuesday, and Bad Parents. Her first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in Late for Dinner in 1991. Her breakthrough role came in Reality Bites (1994) as Winona Ryder's character's Gap-managing best friend Vickie. Her further television work and supporting roles in feature films included Bye Bye Love and Now and Then, and a leading role in I Shot a Man in Vegas. In 1996 she was cast in the starring role in the romantic comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, a variation on Cyrano de Bergerac, which featured Uma Thurman in the top-billed but smaller role as a beautiful but vapid model, while Garofalo played a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an independent film, it became a studio movie when Thurman joined the project. Based on the success of that film, a producer offered Garofalo the part of Dorothy Boyd in Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise if she could lose weight. After trimming down, however, she learned that Renée Zellweger had received the part.[10] She turned down the role of television reporter Gale Weathers in Wes Craven's Scream because she thought the film would be too violent: \"I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie.\"[11] Following up The Truth About Cats and Dogs, Garofalo played the lead role in The Matchmaker, a 1997 romantic comedy film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland; it is Garofalo's first and only lead role to date. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama Cop Land, a police gangster film starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing \"Ursula the Artist\" in Disney's English dub of Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and briefly appeared in Permanent Midnight. In 1999, she starred as \"The Bowler\" in the film Mystery Men, about an underdog group of super heroes. In 2000, she portrayed Abbie Hoffman's wife Anita Hoffman opposite Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman in Steal This Movie!, involving the couple's political activism during the Vietnam War era. Later that same year, she received second billing under Jerry Stiller in a comedic film about a low-budget movie producer entitled The Independent. The following year, Garofalo was top-billed in Wet Hot American Summer, the 2001 cult comedy about an American summer camp, and starred in The Search for John Gissing. In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in The Laramie Project and in 2003, she starred in Manhood and Ash Tuesday, and appeared in the crime film Wonderland. She played a supporting role in Jiminy Glick in Lalawood in 2004. A puppet version of Garofalo appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmakers' lack of correspondence. \"I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more.\"[12] In 2005, she played the ex-wife of a man coping with the reverberations of a divorce in Duane Hopwood. In 2006, she performed Bridget the giraffe's voice in the animated Disney feature film The Wild. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette Tatou, a chef in the Pixar/Disney feature film Ratatouille, in which Garofalo affected a pronounced French accent for the role, appropriate for a character based on a French cook described as the world's best female chef.[13] She made cameo appearances in The Guitar in 2008 and Labor Pains in 2009, and starred in Bad Parents in 2012, a comedy about New Jersey soccer moms obsessing over their children's experiences playing the sport. She starred in the 2015 film 3rd Street Blackout. Television career [edit]Garofalo's big break came in 1990 after meeting Ben Stiller at Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their \"love of SCTV, early Saturday Night Live, and Albert Brooks.\"[14] Her first exposure on national television came soon thereafter by way of her appearance as a stand-up comic on MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour. Subsequently, her first television series debut was on the short-lived Ben Stiller Show on Fox in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to being offered the role of Paula on The Larry Sanders Show on HBO, earning her two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series[15] nominations in 1996 and 1997. For a time, she was actually working on both series simultaneously.[citation needed] After The Ben Stiller Show was cancelled, Garofalo joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for its 1994–95 season.[16] She left SNL in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her \"anxious and depressed\", and that a sexist attitude pervaded the show. She said that many of the sketches were \"juvenile and homophobic\".[17] According to New York Magazine, Garofalo was \"largely stuck in dull, secondary wife and girlfriend roles\", and quoted her friends as saying that she considered the stint \"the most miserable experience of [her] life.\"[18] Following SNL, Garofalo appeared in a plethora of guest star roles: the grown-up daughter of the Buchmans on the final episode of Mad About You; Jerry Seinfeld's female counterpart (and, briefly, fiancée) Jeannie Steinman on Seinfeld; a recurring correspondent on Michael Moore's TV Nation, and a former girlfriend of Dave Foley's character on NewsRadio. She provided the voice for the weekly conversations between the series lead and an older friend (Garofalo) in Felicity. Two television pilots starring Garofalo, the 2003 ABC show Slice O'Life about a reporter consigned to sappy human interest stories appearing at the end of news broadcasts, and the 2005 NBC program All In, based on the life of poker star Annie Duke, were not picked up by their respective networks. Throughout the 2005–06 television season, Garofalo appeared on The West Wing as Louise Thornton, a campaign adviser to the fictional Democratic presidential nominee. In 2006, she provided the voice for the animated character \"Bearded Clam\" on Comedy Central's Freak Show. In 2007, she wrote a dedication for the mini-book included in the six-DVD box-set of the 1994 cult series My So-Called Life. Garofalo had segments titled \"the disquisition\" in several episodes of the 2007 season of The Henry Rollins Show which took place in her apartment, much in the same way Rollins' segments take place at his house.[citation needed] In 2009, Garofalo joined the cast of 24, where she starred as Janis Gold. In 2010, Garofalo joined the cast of Ideal as Tilly. She was a cast member of the Criminal Minds short-lived spinoff TV series Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior in 2011.[19] In 2014, she portrayed Lyla, an entertainment lawyer, in seven episodes of the TV series Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce. In 2015, she starred alongside most of the original cast in the Netflix eight-episode prequel to the 2001 comedy film Wet Hot American Summer. In 2017, Garofalo starred in E4's comedy-drama series Gap Year. She's also appeared in episodes of Younger, Billions, Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens, and Harley Quinn. Writing [edit]Garofalo co-wrote a comedic New York Times bestseller with Ben Stiller in 1999, titled Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction, a spoof of the self-help books prevalent at the time. She wrote her HBO Comedy Half-Hour along with similar appearances and programs, co-wrote some sketches on The Ben Stiller Show and an episode of the television series Head Case, and wrote and directed a 2001 comedy short, Housekeeping.[citation needed] Political and religious views [edit]Garofalo has been open about her liberal political views. She is a feminist. In an interview for Geek Monthly magazine, she stated that she was raised in a conservative family.[20] She has appeared with political figures such as Ralph Nader (whom she supported in the 2000 election, but opposed in 2004) and Jello Biafra at various events. In 2007, Garofalo described herself as an atheist,[21] and participated in a radio interview by Freethought Radio, a show by the Freedom From Religion Foundation.[22] She became more prominent as a liberal when she voiced opposition to what became the 2003 Iraq War, appearing on CNN and Fox News to discuss it. She said that she was approached by groups such as MoveOn.org and Win Without War to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing antiwar voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time said they thought their fame could lend attention to that side of the debate. Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of Ms. and Venus Zine. Garofalo has had frequent on-air political disputes with Bill O'Reilly, Brian Kilmeade, and Jonah Goldberg.[23] Prior to the 2003 Iraq War, she took a position on the alleged threat posed by Saddam Hussein. For example, in an interview with Tony Snow on a February 23, 2003, episode of Fox News Sunday,[24] Garofalo said of the Iraqi leader: Yes, I think lots of people are eager to obtain weapons of mass destruction. But there's no evidence that he (Hussein) has weapons of mass destruction. There's been no evidence of him testing nuclear weapons. We have people that are in our face with nuclear weapons. We've got Iran and North Korea. We've got a problem with Pakistan. You know, I don't know what to say about that. There's a whole lot of people that are going nuclear. And I think that Saddam Hussein is actually, with the evidence, the least able to use nuclear weapons and the least obvious offender in that area at this moment. — Janeane Garofalo, Fox News interview In March 2003, she took part in the Code Pink anti-war march in Washington, D.C.[25] That autumn, she served as emcee at several stops on the Tell Us the Truth tour, a political-themed concert series featuring Steve Earle, Billy Bragg, Tom Morello, and others.[26] Throughout the year, Garofalo also actively campaigned for Howard Dean.[27][28] While on Fox News' program The Pulse, O'Reilly asked Garofalo what she would do if her predictions that the Iraq war would be a disaster were to turn out wrong. Garofalo stated:[29] I would be so willing to say, 'I'm sorry'. I hope to God that I can be made a buffoon of, that people will say, 'You were wrong. You were a fatalist.' And I will go to the White House on my knees on cut glass and say, 'Hey, you and Thomas Friedman were right ... I shouldn't have doubted you ...' — Janeane Garofalo, Fox News interview Garofalo said she had misgivings in 2007 about the depiction of torture in the television series 24 but joined the cast because \"being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance\".[30] In February 2009, Garofalo said on Countdown With Keith Olbermann on MSNBC that then-current Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele suffered from Stockholm Syndrome and that \"any female or person of color in the Republican party is struggling with Stockholm Syndrome\".[31] In April 2009, Garofalo drew criticism from The Washington Times when she denounced Tea Party protests, which she referred to as racist.[32] She continued to criticize Tea Party protesters.[33] In 2009, conservative website and magazine Townhall reported that Garofalo once said \"Our country is founded on a sham. Our forefathers were slave-owning rich white guys who wanted it their way. So when I see the American flag, I go, 'Oh, my god, you’re insulting me.' That you can have a gay pride parade on Christopher Street in New York, with naked men and women on a float, cheering, 'We’re here and we’re queer!' — that’s what makes my heart swell. Not the flag, but a gay naked man or woman burning the flag. I get choked up with pride.\" She received attention and right-wing criticism again in August 2011 after saying on Current TV's former program Countdown with Keith Olbermann that she speculated that 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain was possibly being paid to run for president to deflect from racism in the Republican Party, conservative movement, and Tea Party.[34] She was criticized by Cain, who denied her criticisms and called them \"pathetic and hilarious\".[35] Air America Radio [edit]In late March 2004, Garofalo became a co-host for Air America Radio's new show The Majority Report, alongside Sam Seder. The early days of Air America Radio are chronicled in the documentary Left of the Dial, which includes a debate between Garofalo and her conservative father Carmine, who was initially a regular guest on The Majority Report. Garofalo commented on her show of April 28, 2006, supporting the Scientology-linked New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project, a controversial treatment for workers suffering ailments from 9/11 clean-up efforts in New York City.[36] Garofalo dedicated a number of episodes of \"Majority Report\" to the program and brought conflict between her and her co-host Sam Seder. The show's producer and Seder finally walked off the program when Garofalo said Seder would not have opposed it if it had been \"linked to Jews instead of Scientologists.\"[37] Personal life [edit]Garofalo struggled with alcoholism, giving up drinking in 2001.[38][39] Garofalo married Robert Cohen, then a writer for The Ben Stiller Show, in Las Vegas in 1991. She later explained it was intended as a joke, the pair thinking that the marriage was not binding unless it was filed at a local courthouse. Cohen later became engaged to Jill Leiderman, a producer of Jimmy Kimmel Live!;[40] it was discovered later, when Cohen tried to marry, the marriage was indeed legal. The union with Cohen was dissolved in 2012.[41] In 2019, Garofalo publicly came out as asexual.[42] Filmography [edit]Film [edit]Television [edit]Music videos [edit]- \"Angel Mine\" (Cowboy Junkies) (1996) Documentaries [edit]- New York: A Documentary Film (1999) - Outlaw Comic: The Censoring of Bill Hicks (2003) - Dangerous Living: Coming Out In The Developing World (2003) - Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns) (2003) - Left of the Dial (2005), HBO - I Am Comic (2010) - Misery Loves Comedy (2015) - Sticky: A (Self) Love Story (2016) - Too Soon: Comedy After 9/11 (2021)[45] Awards and nominations [edit]Books [edit]- Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction ISBN 0-694-52146-9 (with Ben Stiller) See also [edit]References [edit]- ^ Thompson, Clifford (2001).
