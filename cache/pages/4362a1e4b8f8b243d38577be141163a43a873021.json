Many good craftsmen left the area and the county has lost something special. On the other hand, I think migrations for these communities from time to time may lend to their survival in the long run. Being seperate/secluded can lead to too few branches in the family tree and sometimes this is evident in physical deformity in some children of the Amish and Mennonites in Missouri and elsewhere. I mean the above sincerely and it is not an attempt to bash the German Mennonite & Amish communities of Missouri. 11-14-2009, 12:28 AM 16,432 posts, read 32,336,654 times Reputation: 25662 Quote: Originally Posted by lifelongMOgal On the other hand, I think migrations for these communities from time to time may lend to their survival in the long run.

I think that there is an effort to have young people marry other Amish/Mennonites from OTHER communities.

Also I have had it with the onset and take over of technology.

They have a thriving Amish community near the town, and I can tell you this on my own personal knowledge. Every couple of weeks or so they would shop at the Alco store I used to manage in Vandalia. From my experience they seemed friendly and hard working, although it ticked me off when they'd leave their horses in my parking lot. 01-13-2010, 11:46 AM Location: Chillicothe, MO 38 posts, read 146,090 times Reputation: 48 Quote: Originally Posted by garth I seem to recall that there are some Amish and/or Mennonite communities in Missouri. Is my memory faulty? If not, are they primarily in the north or are there any in the southern part of the state. Thanks. To go back to the OP. I live in Chillicothe and it's just a hop, skip away from Jamesport in north Missouri. I belive it's the oldest settlement of either Amish or Mennonite west of the Mississippi River. Makes for an interesting day trip. Not some place I'd like to live though. The residents are friendly enough. I've had no issues personally with them, but know of persons that have. They are always carefull in their business dealings with the Amish and Mennonites. I've seen no food lines, discrimination to outsiders, or other problems. My husband, by appearance only, is usually assumed to be disabled. He's never encountered any problems. My only problem with the community is that I think they still do not vaccinate their children for common diseases. After a visit I contracted chicken pox as an adult. Not pleasent. I was told later that a rather large family had an outbreak and had sent someone to the store for supplys. Just so happened they were in the store at the same time I was. Something one poster should consider before going to live with them! 01-14-2010, 09:36 PM Location: Missouri 1,554 posts, read 4,731,856 times Reputation: 744 I just looked at a Amish home for Sale in Northern part of Missouri. I had to asked where they would be moving one of the older boy replied they are moving to Iowa and the reason was not enough Amish community here and there is a bigger community in Iowa so they can get there kids married off. Sad though because I love having the Amish around. 01-15-2010, 12:31 AM Location: Indiana Uplands 27,569 posts, read 50,718,215 times Reputation: 20866 Quote: Originally Posted by kareybear the older boy replied they are moving to Iowa and the reason was not enough Amish community here and there is a bigger community in Iowa so they can get there kids married off. . That sounds like an old order Amish group. That practice would be common a century or two ago. 04-17-2010, 03:21 PM 1 posts, read 10,105 times Reputation: 19 Hi Linda. Living with the Amish will not give you what you are after. Please understand that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with driving only a horse and buggy (or walking), not having electricity, few conveniences, being \"plain\", etc. However, none of these things will bring you closer to God. And if one thinks that it will, then they are practicing salvation by works, and rejecting the sacrifice of Christ, and his shed blood for the covering of ALL our sins. (Rom. 3:28-30, Rom. 4:5, Rom. 5:1, Rom. 9:30, Rom. 10:4, Rom. 11:6, Gal. 2:16, Gal. 2:21, Gal.3.5-6, Gal.3:5-6, [Gal. 3:24, Eph. 2:8-9, Phil. 3:9) Linda, your peace will come by making friends with the Holy Spirit, not by making friends with the Amish...not that you shouldn't make friends with the Amish. But if you need peace, then \"Ask and it shall be given, knock and it shall be opened unto you...\" Remember, it is peace you are after, not an intense life of work. (BTW, work is good, but we need peace in our heart, peace with God. He will enable you to work hard with a joyful spirit.) 09-30-2010, 08:57 PM 1 posts, read 9,527 times Reputation: 11 You are full of it! I can tell you buddy.... YOU ARE FULL OF IT! I have delt with the Amish and been going to their auctions and sales for years! They have never served horsemeat burgers and anytime the Amish are doing the concessions you will have EXCELLENT food at a fair price with a generous portion! As for good ole Elmer well.... I'm sure he will get the better end of the deal if you let him but you need to be responsible for yourself and buy your horse like a \"big boy\" If you can't buy your own horse and like it when you get home then get a professional to help you.
