  "title": "If you are providing 2 liters per minute of oxygen to a patient what percentage of oxygen are they breathing? - Answers",
  "text": "Human lungs are 2 liters in volume by average. So... Average breath rate is 12 breaths per minute. In one minute the patient would take in 24 liters of air. You are supplying 2 liters of pure oxygen + 4.8 liters from air (20% of the 24 liters (Percent oxygen in dry air)) = 6.8 liters of Oxygen per minute. 6.8 liters oxygen / 24 liters intake = 28.3% Oxygen or you can look at the table given by the books at http://www.fpnotebook.com/ER/Procedure/LwFlwOxygn.htm Nasal Cannula, Flow 0 liters per minute: 21% (Room Air), Flow 2 liters per minute: 29% But I like the mathematical method. That's just me! If a substance is 28% oxygen, it means that 28% of the total substance is oxygen. To find the amount of oxygen in liters, you would need to know the total volume of the substance. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of oxygen in liters. 4 liters of oxygen is 100% oxygen because the volume is entirely filled with oxygen. To determine how many liters of oxygen is in a 40% concentration, you would need to know the total volume of the substance in question. Then, you would multiply the percentage (40%) by the total volume to find the volume of oxygen. A yard of topsoil weighs approximately 2,000-2,200 pounds. In liters, a yard of topsoil is equivalent to about 764-836 liters. There is no direct conversion between liters and pounds of soil as they are measuring different properties (volume vs. weight). To convert liters to pounds, you would need to know the density of the soil. You would multiply the volume in liters by the density of the soil to get the weight in pounds."
