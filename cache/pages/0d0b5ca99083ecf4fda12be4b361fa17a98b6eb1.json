  "text": "encantada = enchanted It can also be used to respond to an introduction as a form of \"nice to meet you.\" In this way it's like the French \"Enchantée\". One is used for a boy and the other is used for a girl. the one ending in a is girl and the one ending in o is for boys Nice to see you in Spanish is me alegro de verte. This is an example of a proper Spanish greeting. It means \"what do you need for English class\". In order to respond, you would say in Spanish what you need for English class. In Spanish you're not normally asked to 'have' a day, rather, you're asked to 'pass' a day. In this case, you would be asked to \"Pass a day beautiful or enchanting of wedding.\" It looks like this: Pasen un dia bella/encantada de boda. This is a wish for the couple rather than one of the pair. Spanish makes those kinds of distinctions."
