  "text": "Whats the deal with the ending of Smile? So I just finished watching it, great movie but it seems needlessly depressing. The ending feels like it was made that way solely to subvert expectations and it doesnt really deliver a good message. The whole movie was about trauma and its not that good when the trauma ends up winning and killing the main character. The entire movie too everyone treats Rose like shes crazy which is understandable but then she dies so nobody will ever know except for Joel (whos cursed now). It makes sense for a character to overcome trauma thats a good message for audience members but this just kinda felt depressing for the sake of being a sad ending. Also Joel was a bit of a dumbass in the end. He knows how the entity works due to Rose telling him but then he still tries busting down the door and getting inside knowing thats exactly what the entity wanted since Rose literally told him her plan of being isolated to draw it out. Did anyone else feel the same? Aside from the ending though I mean it was a great movie the entity’s design was amazing and the whole movie just put this feeling of uneasiness and uncomfortableness in me."
