  "text": "Anyone who's embraced Alexa likely has an Echo product to thank. Since 2014, Amazon's smart speakers and displays have been listening for their wake words, ready to set timers and give you the weather, among other things. Amazon's next-gen Alexa+ promises more natural conversations with Amazon's AI. But while Alexa on an app is nice, Amazon has some pretty cool hardware to house its virtual assistant, too. If you're wondering which one to get on Black Friday, read on for a rundown of what each device brings to the table. Amazon Echo Dot The Echo Dot has long been a space-conscious, affordable way to bring Alexa into your home. And Amazon's formerly puck-shaped smart speaker now has a more orb-like form and a glowing blue LED. Ultrasound motion detectors let the smart speaker respond to tap gestures and movement. Plus, it includes Eero mesh Wi-Fi support, so Amazon Dots can serve as network nodes that can add up to 1,000 square feet of coverage to an Eero Wi-Fi network. (A version with an LED clock was unfortunately discontinued in 2024.) Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition The Echo Dot Kids Edition is shaped like the Echo Dot, but comes in owl, dragon, rainbow swirl, and stardust prints. It packs some kid-friendly features, like one free year of Amazon Kids+ for thousands of hours of kid-friendly Audible books, interactive games, and educational skills. (After a year, Amazon Kids+ is $5.99/month.) This Echo Dot also comes with a two-year, worry-free guarantee, so if it breaks, Amazon will replace it for free. Amazon Echo Dot Max The Echo Dot Max replaces the 4th-gen Echo at the $99 price point. It runs an AZ3 chip for \"better conversation detection,\" Amazon says, while its dual speakers promise fuller bass. In our tests, we found that the Echo Dot Max delivers impressive sound for its size, as well as robust connectivity and smart home integration, and access to Alexa+. All that earns it our Editors' Choice award as the best all-around smart speaker. Amazon Echo Studio (2nd Gen) Amazon has slimmed down its Echo Studio speaker in a spherical package that looks more like the Echo Dot. It now measures 6.1 by 5.6 by 5.8 inches (HWD), down from 8.1 by 6.9 by 6.9 inches, but still a few inches bigger than the Echo Dot Max. In our tests, we found that this second-gen Studio is Amazon's smartest and clearest-sounding Alexa speaker yet, though the bass is less powerful than the original. You do, however, get extra sensors, connectivity options, and Alexa+. Amazon Echo Pop The baseline of the Alexa hardware experience is now the angled Echo Pop. Effectively a cheaper version of the orb-shaped Echo Dot, the Pop boasts a larger front-firing speaker and slightly different look, without sacrificing its Alexa-powered voice assistance functions. Designed to fit into small spaces like a dorm room or bathroom, the Echo Pop also features Amazon's AZ2 Neural Edge processor and can serve as a network extender for Eero mesh networks. Amazon Echo Pop Kids This kids' version of the Echo Pop smart speaker features Marvel, Anthro Pup, Disney Princess, and unicorn characters and comes with six months of Amazon Kids+. Amazon Echo Spot The original orb-shaped Echo Spot came out in 2017 as a more compact, clock-radio-like alternative to the Echo Show devices. But it was largely ignored until Amazon released an updated Echo Spot in 2024 that sits between a smart speaker and a full smart display. In our review, we found that new Echo Spot's display isn't too impressive, but it performs quite well as a smart speaker, provides useful bits of information, and offers basic smart home controls. Amazon Echo Show 15 The Echo Show 15 is designed to be easily mounted on a wall, though Amazon is now selling it with an adjustable stand for an extra $125. It features a 15.6-inch, 1080p LCD surrounded by a large, picture-frame-like bezel that can look like a painting or smart frame when not in use. It includes Fire TV support and the visual ID feature. Amazon promises better audio quality, plus more bass and noise-reduction tech than the original, as well as an improved camera for video calls with a 65% zoom and auto-framing to keep you centered in a video chat. In our review, we found that its camera improvements help justify the higher price. Amazon Echo Show 21 The Echo Show 21 is wall-mountable, so it could double as a picture frame, a small TV, a security camera feed, a smart home lighting hub, or even a digital fireplace. Amazon is also selling an adjustable stand for an extra $125. There's a 13MP wide-angle camera with auto-framing, while a visual ID feature can identify anyone in a household who stands in front of it and loads their own calendars and lists. It features Wi-Fi 6E capabilities and costs $399.99. In our review, we said it's fairly expensive and produces only average sound but is worth checking out if you want the biggest smart display possible, Amazon Echo Hub This scaled-down Echo Show 15 looks like a thermostat or home security system, but it’s an 8-inch touch-enabled display where you can manage smart cameras, organize widgets, or just check the time. In our review, we found it to be an excellent value compared with the similar Brilliant Control ($399), a dedicated smart home control panel that retails for more than twice as much. The Echo Hub stands out for its smart home prowess, especially if you prefer to control your devices from a screen rather than with your voice.

Amazon Echo Show 8 Amazon gave its Echo Show devices a slight makeover this fall, but they're not a huge departure from the previous-gen versions. The new Echo Show 8 features an 8.7-inch HD display and a 13MP camera with auto-framing capabilities, which will recognize and greet you when you approach it. In our review, we found that the newest Echo Show 8's upgraded speakers offer richer sound, while a faster processor makes for more seamless and natural voice interactions with Alexa+. It earns our Editors' Choice as the best Amazon smart display for most people. Get it now in graphite or glacier white. Add an adjustable stand for $40. Amazon Echo Show 5 For something even smaller, the third-gen Echo Show 5 improves on the previous model with a speaker designed for deeper bass and 20% faster request response time, so you can set that alarm, add that grocery list item, or hear that joke marginally quicker. Available in black, blue, white, the 5.5-inch smart display fits virtually anywhere in your home, and comes with a 2MP HD camera and built-in shutter, as well the option to turn off the microphone and camera. Amazon Echo Show 11 If you need a little more screen real estate, the Echo Show 11 features an 11-inch HD display. In our review, we found that it's best-suited for large rooms, but combines excellent sound quality, a large screen, and the conversational smarts of Alexa+ for easy voice control. Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids The kid-centric Echo Show 5 makes it easy for little ones to ask Alexa for homework help, make video calls to pre-approved contacts, and set wake-up alarms in the voice of their favorite characters. Now with an additional mic for improved voice-assist responsiveness and a faster AZ2 Neural Edge processor, the device comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+ (starting at $5.99 per month for Prime members after the first year) for access to thousands of books, movies, TV shows, educational apps, games, and skills. There's also a two-year \"worry-free guarantee,\" which offers a free replacement for broken displays. Amazon Echo Glow This colorful smart light orb is intended for kids. Ask Alexa to change the Glow's colors; tap to make it flicker like a campfire or flash while an Echo Dot plays music for a dance party. The Echo Glow doesn't work with any Alexa skills and can't be set to flash or give any indication of you getting a message or alert. But for the price, it seems like a fine smart light for your kids' rooms. (Not to be confused with the now-defunct Amazon Glow, a $300 smart speaker plus projector that let kids connect with faraway loved ones and play games.) Amazon Echo Buds (2023) Amazon's Echo Buds true wireless earphones promise up to five hours of music playback per charge, and a sub-$50 price tag. The in-ear accessory, which sports an easy-hold stem, connect to two devices at the same time, so you can take that video call from computer to phone without missing a beat. Echo Buds are compatible with iOS and Android, with hands-free access to Alexa, Siri, and the Google Assistant. Amazon Echo Buds With ANC The second-generation Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which offer hands-free Alexa voice control, improve upon Amazon's original true wireless earphones with a smaller, lighter design and active noise cancellation. These Echo Buds are smaller and lighter than their predecessor, offer genuine active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. Amazon Smart Plug The Smart Plug is part of a line of products called Alexa Gadgets, which need to be connected to other Echo smart speakers. It connects to Echo devices like the Dot to turn compatible devices with mechanical on and off switches into smart ones. You can then say things like \"Alexa, turn on the coffee pot.\" Amazon Echo Frames (3rd Gen) The $269.99 Echo Frames ($389.99 for the Carrera-branded version) offer hands-free access to Alexa to make calls, request podcasts or Audible books, set reminders, and other tasks. The third-gens promise extended battery life (up to six hours of continuous media playback), better Alexa performance, and a more stylish look. In our review, we found them to be better looking and more comfortable than ever, while falling short on audio quality. Amazon Echo Auto (2nd Gen) Google has Android Auto and Apple has CarPlay, so it was inevitable that Amazon would also get into the automotive space. The Echo Auto debuted in 2018 as a small device that attaches to the dashboard and responds to questions just like it would at home. A slimmed-down (and more expensive) version arrived in 2022 for $54.99. As we found in our review, the latest Echo Auto is ultimately just a good microphone that lets you use Alexa voice controls in your car. It's not any more unique than the Alexa mobile app, but it might be able to hear you better. Fire HD Tablets With Hands-Free Alexa They're not Echo devices, but the Amazon Fire HD color tablets have hands-free Alexa support (even if the screen is asleep), meaning they can do everything the Echo Show does. Amazon gave its 8-inch Fire HD 8 tablets a refresh in late 2024, adding some AI perks and more RAM to support it. The Fire HD 8 Kids and HD 8 Kids Pro got the same RAM upgrade. Check out the rest of the lineup below. With the exception of the kid-focused tablets, these prices are \"With Lockscreen Ads\"; get rid of them by paying an extra $15."
