  "text": "Do you know the difference between a canoe and a sail boat? there's canoes in sabaody... which he coulda used to get to mf there's small boats in sabaody. there's sail boats in sabaody. there's huge caravels in sabaody. There's all kinds of boats in sabaody. And ray is a pirate with years and years of experience and we have literally seen him manning a gigantic marine battleship along with jimbe... If he wanted to go to mf, he would be there. you can’t prove a single goddamn thing about any of these timelines except that Rayleigh is slower than a submarine you don't have anything about sabaody being too far from mf or ray not being able to get there. You just coping hard. I can give you chapter numbers and statements The fuck you got? I would continue but I know you have nothing else besides your headcanon lol you haven't posted shit from the manga to disprove me cause you literally don't have ANYTHING here you go. Sabaody and mf being right next to each other in the manga Disprove that"
