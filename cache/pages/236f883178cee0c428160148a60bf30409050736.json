Dementia vs. normal aging A recent survey revealed that nearly half of adults aged 40 and older think they will likely develop dementia.[1] An estimated 6.9 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with dementia. That is about 1 in 9 people (10.9%) of the U.S. population.1 The truth is, dementia is not a normal part of normal aging. Many older adults live their entire lives without developing dementia. Normal aging may include weakening muscles and bones, stiffening arteries and vessels, and some age-related memory changes. Normal age-related memory changes As we get older, normal memory changes may include: - Forgetting where you put your car keys sometimes. - Struggling to find a word but remembering it later. - Forgetting the name of an acquaintance. - Forgetting the most recent events. These subtle changes can be frustrating. But they should not affect your daily life. With normal aging, your overall memory, thought, and brain functions stay intact. This includes: - The knowledge and experiences you gained over years. - Old memories. - Language. What to look out for There are many types of dementia that cause problems remembering, thinking, or making daily decisions. Dementia symptoms can vary widely from person to person. Symptoms People with dementia have problems with one or more of these things: - Memory. - Attention. - Communication. - Reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. - Vision problems such as depth perception, processing visual cues, or recognizing objects. Telltale signs Signs that may point to dementia include: - Getting lost in a familiar neighborhood. - Using unusual words to refer to familiar objects. - Forgetting the name of a close family member or friend. - Forgetting old memories. - Not being able to complete common tasks on your own. See your health care provider if you notice any of these signs or symptoms. The sooner you can figure out what’s causing these changes the sooner you can work with your provider to get a diagnosis and figure out next steps. When to talk to your doctor What to do if you think you might have Dementia Talk to your health care provider to see if your symptoms are related to dementia or a more treatable condition. Early and accurate diagnosis may help slow the progression and alleviate some symptoms. Early diagnosis also allows you and your family to consider: - Treatment options. - Financial planning. - Developing advance directives. - Enrolling in clinical trials. - Anticipating any care needs. - Alzheimer's Association. 2024 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures.
