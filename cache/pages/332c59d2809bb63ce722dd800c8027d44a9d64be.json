The homeowner worked with Kitchen Designer, Amanda Ortendahl of our North Attleboro location to update what was a dark wood G-shaped kitchen they had installed when they built the home 20 years earlier. The new design incorporates a large working island with ample seating for entertaining, homework and casual meals. The cabinets incorporate substantial crown molding and soar all the way to the ceiling adding to the feeling of height and spaciousness. The cabinets are all by Fieldstone Cabinetry. The perimeter cabinets are a painted finish in the color White. The island, hood and wine bar are Rattan Stain on walnut wood. The countertop and backsplash are Brunello Element Quartz. The plumbing fixtures are the Litze collection from Brizo in Luxe Gold. The coordinating hardware is from Top Knobs in their Honey Bronze finish. Remodel by Maynard Construction BRC, Inc.
