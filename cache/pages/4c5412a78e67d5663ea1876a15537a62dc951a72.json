My friends and I really enjoy playing Phasmophobia, but since we've played it quite a bit, it's starting to get a bit stale. We're eager to try other games that are similar to it, but we're not sure which ones to go for. We've also tried Demonologist, but besides the jump scares, it didn't offer much else and quickly lost our interest. What we're really looking for is a game like Phasmophobia that allows co-op play with at least up to 4 people. It should keep us tensed without relying too heavily on jump scares."
