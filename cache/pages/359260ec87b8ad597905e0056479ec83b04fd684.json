At TASTE we go the extra mile to source better-for-you foods with minimally processed ingredients and to make foods from scratch. We believe in the power of Good Food to nurture, fuel and heal. Our commitment to high quality foods encompasses both our prepared foods and our retail offerings. Our retail shelves house an ever-changing collection of exclusively curated products from artisanal producers, with an emphasis on the fine food and wine made right here in Virginia. We feature fine cheese, cured meats, craft beer, wine, and gourmet provisions from chocolate to Virginia peanuts. We seek out foods made on family farms and by small producers who are zealous about preparing foods of integrity using traditional methods. We form close relationships with these producers and offer regular tastings to expose our customers to their products and share the story behind them. Connecting you to these producers (and them to you) is part of our mission to Cultivate Community through The Good Life. our food promise Small-batch, from-scratch, clean foods.
