  "text": "Since the beginning, Fresh-hotel started out small and continued its glory to becoming the best and longest running retro on the internet. To this day most users want fresh to become bigger and grow into a larger community, these things come through and everyone is loving what Fresh has become. Now join the party and play Fresh till the end of days. Kane is always making improvements to Fresh and most people enjoy it, and others hate the updates and the hotel itself, (well then don't play it dipshit). The staff and users make this retro The best running one since the beginning of time. Fresh has always been the best hotel there ever was to me and to most of you probably. Now how about we keep this hotels legacy going and support the Staff and Kane for making this hotels legacy's beginning. Now lets make this hotel never ending and keep playing. Enjoy your stay at Fresh-Hotel."
