  "text": "What is the difference between %zu and %lu in string formatting in C? %lu is used for unsigned long values and %zu is used for size_t values, but in practice, size_t is just an unsigned long . CppCheck complains about it, but both work for both types in my experience. Is %zu just a standardized way of formatting size_t because size_t is commonly used, or is there more to it?"
