Uber is an on-demand car service that allows users to request a ride through their Android or iPhone app. Once a driver is signaled through the app, it usually takes less than 10 minutes for a car to arrive at your door. During this brief wait period, Uber allows you to track the cars location so you know exactly when to expect its arrival. The app provides a cashless payment process by charging all Uber rides to an on file credit card attached to your account. One thing to note though, sometimes Uber enacts surge pricing during peak travel times, meaning your fare could double, triple, or even cost you up to 7X the normal amount! On the plus side, when surge pricing is in effect you will be notified within the app before you request a ride. Uber is currently available in 67 countries!
