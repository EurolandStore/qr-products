  "text": "sent this afternoon to jeff@amazon.com I have been a Prime member for over a decade, but, at this time, I do not plan to renew my membership after its June 16 expiration. Your consumer store business has, essentially, two classes of customer - Prime member and other. Your advertising claims Prime customers receive a higher standard of service - yet you regularly ship to Prime customers via USPS. USPS as a parcel service is unreliable and untruthful. My experience with them as your last-mile package router has been that ninety-five times out of one hundred, their e-mailed delivery notices are sent at least a day in advance of actual delivery. One presumes that this is to meet the terms of the contract Amazon signed with them. If they lie to me most of the time, they must have violated the terms of your agreement thousands, perhaps millions, of times over. I am sensitive to the fact that your organization is likely jawboned by representatives of the Federal government to support the agency, with future problems implied if you do not. There is, however, *no* reason to subject the (literal) premium class of customers to the inferior service that they provide. One is forced to conclude that your Prime customers are taken for granted (the kindest characterization that I could come up with). For what I purchase, there are very few cases where Amazon is the only source. It may take a few minutes more searching online, but that is preferable to the increasing lack of value that Prime provides, as well as a lack of respect for me as a customer. Sincerely,"
