  "text": "Danilo has completed his exit from Rangers, joining NEC Nijmegen on loan. The forward, 26, has joined the Eredivisie side on a temporary deal until the end of the season, returning to the Netherlands. Nijmegen hold an option to buy the Brazilian striker in the summer should they wish to keep him beyond his initial loan. The move was delayed for a couple of days as the Ibrox side finalised their move for Ryan Naderi prior to last night's 11pm deadline. A club statement reads: \"We can today confirm Danilo has joined NEC Nijmegen on a loan deal until the end of the season with an option to buy. \"Everyone at the club wishes Danilo well for his loan spell.\" Danilo was in the stands on Saturday as NEC recorded an impressive 3-1 win over AZ Alkmaar.

Ravaged by injury issues during his time at Ibrox, Danilo scored 16 goals and provided 11 assists in 76 appearances. Asked about the forward earlier today before tomorrow night's match against Kilmarnock, Danny Rohl commented: \"I cannot confirm, but I think we also prepared something with him, let's see what happens during this day, and maybe we can confirm more in which direction it goes.\""
