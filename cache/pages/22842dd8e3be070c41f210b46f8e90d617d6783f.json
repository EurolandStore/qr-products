  "text": "- Aug 13, 2022 - 102 - Pool Size - 6000 - Surface - Vinyl - Chlorine - Salt Water Generator - SWG Type - Hayward Aqua Rite (T-15) I have decided to close the pool, and am going to start a re-build soon (Meeting builder next week). Instead of leaving it full to become a cesspool breeding ground, I am trying to figure out how to drain it? I know I can backwash it to get below skimmer (Likely a bad choice), but how do I drain it even lower? I feel like the answer likes in the jandy switch by the filter, but if that comes from the skimmer... then that would drain all the time? Is it a pump setting like 'Waste'? (I've only ever used on/backwash) I know I can backwash it to get below skimmer (Likely a bad choice), but how do I drain it even lower?
