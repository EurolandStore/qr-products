  "text": "Addition using Number Line - Step 1: Begin by positioning the first number (2) as the starting point on the number line. - Step 2: Next, progress from the first number by units equivalent to the second number towards the right. This is due to the ascending nature of values on the number line toward the right. For instance, when adding 2 + 5, advance 5 units to the right. This progression leads to the number 7. Hence, 2 + 5 = 7. The following animation demonstrates the Number Line method, Need support for a different topic or want to share a feedback? Write to us and we'll work on adding it.

Addition using Place Values - Step 1: Arrange the numbers 2, 5 (addends) to align them properly in respective columns for ones, tens, hundreds, and Thousands… stacking them vertically. - Step 2: Sum the numbers from the rightmost column, moving leftward, beginning with the ones column, followed by the tens column, and hundreds column till the leftmost column. - Step 3: If the sum in any of the columns is more than 9, we regroup this sum into tens and ones. We write the ones digit of this sum under that particular column and we carry over the tens digit of the sum to the next column. This carried-over digit is added along with the addends of that specific column. - Step 4: The total of the provided numbers is achieved by adding all the columns together. In this problem, the total is 7 The following animation demonstrates the Place Value method, Need support for a different topic or want to share a feedback? Write to us and we'll work on adding it.
