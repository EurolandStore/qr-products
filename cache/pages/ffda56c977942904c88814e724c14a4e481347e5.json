  "text": "Wonder Woman (2017 film) Wonder Woman is a 2017 superhero film based on the character from DC Comics. Directed by Patty Jenkins from a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, based on a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, it is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Gal Gadot stars as the title character, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. Depicting the character's origin story, the film follows Diana, an Amazon princess, who leaves her home island of Themyscira during World War I after American pilot and spy Steve Trevor crash-lands on the island and informs her about the ongoing conflict. Believing the war is orchestrated by Ares, the god of war, she sets out to stop him and end the suffering. Development of a live-action Wonder Woman film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman initially set to produce and possibly direct. The project remained in development hell for many years, with writers and directors like Jon Cohen, Todd Alcott, and Joss Whedon attached at various points. Warner Bros. officially announced the film in 2010, and Patty Jenkins was hired as director in 2015. The film drew inspiration from William Moulton Marston's 1940s Wonder Woman stories, George Pérez's 1980s comics, and the New 52 version of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, concluding on May 9, 2016. Additional filming occurred in November 2016. Wonder Woman premiered at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on May 26, 2017, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 2. The film received critical acclaim for its direction, performances, visuals, story, action sequences, and cultural significance, though some criticism was directed at the climax. It grossed over $824 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2017 and the highest-grossing film by a solo female director until it was surpassed by Barbie (2023). The American Film Institute included it in its top ten films of 2017, and it won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2018. A sequel, Wonder Woman 1984, was released in December 2020, with Patty Jenkins returning as director and Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Connie Nielsen reprising their roles. Plans for a third film were canceled after DC Films was restructured into DC Studios in 2022. Plot [edit]In present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate from Wayne Enterprises of herself and four men taken during World War I, prompting her to recall her past.[a] Diana, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, is raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, women warriors created by the Olympian gods to protect mankind. Hippolyta tells Diana the story of how Ares became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound him and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the \"god-killer\", to prepare them for Ares' return. Overprotecting Diana, Hippolyta conceals Diana's true origin from her, but reluctantly agrees to let her sister, Antiope, train Diana as a warrior. In 1918, Diana rescues U.S. pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by German soldiers, who had been pursuing him. The Amazons suffer some casualties, but wipe out the German landing force, with Antiope sacrificing herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook from the Germans' chief chemist, Dr. Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"god-killer\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve. In London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes, revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Man's Land and destroys the enemy trench, liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love. The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party; he intends to locate the gas and destroy it and she hopes to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. She fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war. Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself to be Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"god-killer\" sword, he destroys it before revealing to Diana that she is the \"god-killer\", since she is the daughter of Zeus. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have goodness within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, definitively killing him. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight on the world's behalf as Wonder Woman. Cast [edit]- Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman: An immortal Amazon warrior demigoddess who is the crown princess of Themyscira and the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus being raised by the Amazons.[8] Describing Wonder Woman and her appeal, Gadot said \"She's relatable. She has the heart of a human and is very compassionate, but her experiences—or lack of them, her naivete, really—make her interested in everything around her and able to view the world in a way that we'd all like to: with a genuine curiosity.\"[9] On Diana going to human world, Gadot stated \"When Diana comes to the real world she's completely oblivious about gender and society rules, that women are not equal to men.\"[10] Additionally, Lilly Aspell and Emily Carey portray young Diana, respectively.[11][12] - Chris Pine as Steve Trevor: An American pilot and the love interest of Diana.[13][14] On his role for the film, Pine said \"I am an American pilot who's a spy. It's like a boy's dream: You're either a spy or a fighter pilot. The first thing I wanted to be was a fighter pilot a long time ago. I wanted to be Goose [from Top Gun]\".[15] Pine describe his character as a \"rogue-ish, cynical realist who's seen the awful brutish nature of modern civilization\" and added that he is a \"worldly guy, a charming guy\".[16] - Robin Wright as Antiope: The sister of Hippolyta, general of the Amazonian army, Diana's aunt and mentor.[17] Describing her character mentoring and training Diana to be a warrior, Wright said \"It's a sixth sense that it is coming and I think that's also in the mythological story behind Antiope and Queen Hippolyta. They know it's coming and it's her duty as the aunt to her young niece to make sure she is the fiercest warrior of all time.\" On the Amazons fighting style, Wright said \"It's hand combat. Yes, swords and knives and arrows, but the precision that they have, right, as these warrior women; it's so nice to see that disparity between what we had in the day of just raw fighting materials and the guns and how easy that is in comparison.\"[18] - Danny Huston as Erich Ludendorff: An iron-fisted general of the German Army during World War I.[19] Huston described Ludendorff as a \"pragmatist, realist, patriotic, fighting for his country\", further explaining, \"he lost his son on the German front lines and was just quite tortured, diabolical, stubborn and believes that what he's doing is for the betterment of mankind.\"[20] On his character, Huston said \"Ludendorff is a believer that war is a natural habitat for humans.\"[21] - David Thewlis as Sir Patrick Morgan/Ares: A speaker for peace on the Imperial War Cabinet later revealed to be Ares, based on the Greek mythological god of war, who is secretly working behind the scenes to ensure humanity's destruction.[22][23][24] Describing the Sir Patrick persona of his character, Thewlis said \"Sir Patrick's entire drive through the other half of the story is to bring about the armistice. That's his whole intention no matter what's going on. He meets Diana and sees in her somebody who is sympathetic to his cause, quite vehemently so.\"[25] - Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta: The Amazon Queen of Themyscira and Diana's mother.[26] On her character being Diana's mother and Amazonian queen, Nielsen stated \"I'm queen and I'm preparing my child for a world that entails a lot of responsibility. So it was important to me to bring that into the character.\"[27] She read The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor to familiarize herself with women warriors and said \"I used what I learned in Mayor's book as a rallying cry for how I approached Hippolyta. And then, of course, what is a leader who is elected by her peers every year and has been doing this for a thousand years? That too was interesting to think about\".[28] - Elena Anaya as Dr. Isabel Maru/ Doctor Poison: The chief chemist associated with General Ludendorff who specializes in chemistry and poisons.[19] On her role, Anaya said \"Well, it was a small role in this big ensemble, but it is an important character in the story. I'm going to be a big nightmare\" for Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor.[29] Describing her character, Anaya said \"Dr. Maru loves rage and enjoys people's pain. She's creating terrible weapons and her purpose in life is to kill as many people as possible and provoke as much pain as possible\". She researched World War I and Fritz Haber, the scientist who created mustard gas, to prepare for the role.[30] On the character's facial scars, Anaya said Dr. Maru scarred her own face by testing her gas on herself to provoke suffering, showing her sadistic nature. She described the character as the opposite of Wonder Woman, with a strong ability to inflict pain.[31] On Dr. Maru's relationship with General Ludendorff, Anaya said \"I think that they have a relationship based on loyalty. Ludendorff is a very tormented General that lacks self-confidence. That's why, in part, he takes these drugs that Dr. Poison gives him. They are from different worlds, but they complement each other\".[32] - Lucy Davis as Etta Candy: Steve Trevor's secretary who befriends Diana.[33] Describing her character, Davis said \"She's a woman in a man's world and so being heard and seen aren't the easiest things, but it kind of doesn't deter her\", adding, \"Etta is unapologetically herself and I think that that's the thing that has drawn me to her the most\".[34] - Saïd Taghmaoui as Sameer: A secret agent and ally of Steve Trevor.[35][36] On his casting, Taghmaoui stated \"I was among hundreds of potential candidates and I slowly became the favorite\", adding, \"It wasn't easy. It took me three months. [I'll have to go through] extensive physical training.\" - Ewen Bremner as Charlie: A sharpshooter and ally of Steve Trevor.[35] On his role, Bremner said \"I play a character who's enlisted by Wonder Woman to help save the world as part of a small, unlikely band\". Describing his character, Bremner stated, \"He's a shellshocked soldier who's been discharged from the war and is brought back to help on a secret mission.\"[37] - Eugene Brave Rock as Chief: A Blackfoot demi-god,[38] and a smuggler who trades with both sides of the war and knows how to get people across the front lines.[35][39] - Lisa Loven Kongsli as Menalippe: Antiope's lieutenant and Diana's aunt.[17] Describing her character, Kongsli said \"Menalippe is a fearless warrior with a strong justice needs. She lives with the other Amazons on the island Themyscira and exercising continuous battle to assist man in the fight for the good.\"[40] Additionally, Ann Ogbomo, Mayling Ng, Florence Kasumba, Madeleine Vall Beijner, Hayley Jane Warnes, Ann Wolfe and Eleanor Matsuura portray Philippus, Orana, Acantha, Egeria, Aella, Artemis and Epione, respectively, all of whom are Amazons.[41][42][43][44] James Cosmo appears as Douglas Haig, Steffan Rhodri appears as Colonel Darnell and Dutch supermodel Doutzen Kroes portrays the Amazon Venelia.[43] Samantha Jo was cast as the Amazonian Euboea and previously played the Kryptonian, Car-Vex, in Man of Steel.[45] Zack Snyder also makes a brief cameo appearance in the film as an unnamed soldier.[46] Production [edit]Background [edit]Development for a live-action Wonder Woman feature film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman attached as producer and possible director.[47] In 1999, the project became attached to Jon Cohen, who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver, with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star.[48] By 2001, Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay, with Silver Pictures backing the project.[49] At that time, Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta-Jones were also rumored to be possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman.[50] Leonard Goldberg focused on Bullock[51] who said that she was approached for the role. Lucy Lawless, the star of Xena: Warrior Princess, was also under consideration, though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was portrayed as a \"flawed hero\".[52] The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott, Cohen, Becky Johnston and Philip Levens,[53] and by August 2003, Levens had been replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis.[54] In March 2005, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would write and direct the film.[55] Early drafts of his screenplay included Steve Trevor as the narrator, a fierce battle between Diana and her mother over Trevor's welfare and after leaving Themyscira, his need to frequently rescue a Diana rendered helpless by the modern world.[56] Whedon was not able to complete a final version of his screenplay and left the project in 2007.[57][58] Although Whedon stated in May 2005 that he would not cast the part of Wonder Woman until he finished the script,[59] Kate Beckinsale was linked to the part.[60] Beckinsale declined as she thought the script wasn't good.[61] In 2010, Whedon admitted that he did have an actress in mind for the part, stating that \"Wonder Woman was basically Angelina Jolie.\"[56][62] Cobie Smulders was Whedon's choice for the part.[63] A day before Whedon's departure from Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures purchased a spec script for the film written by Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland. Set during World War II, the script impressed executives at Silver Pictures.[58] However, Silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want the rights reverting; while stating the script had good ideas, Silver did not want the film to be a period piece.[64] That same year, Warner Bros. began development of a Justice League film with Michele and Kieran Mulroney writing the screenplay. The film, entitled Justice League: Mortal, was to be directed by George Miller and would have featured Wonder Woman in her cinematic debut. Australian model Megan Gale was ultimately cast in the role in January 2008. The film would later be cancelled following production delays and budgetary concerns.[65] By April 2008, Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new script set in contemporary times that would not depict Wonder Woman's origin, but explore Paradise Island's history.[66] Development [edit]In 2010, Warner Bros. stated that a Wonder Woman film was in development, along with films based on DC Comics superheroes the Flash and Aquaman.[67] Both Wonder Woman and Aquaman were still under consideration for solo film subjects as of June 2013.[68] DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson said Wonder Woman \"has been, since I started, one of the top three priorities for DC and for Warner Bros. We are still trying right now, but she's tricky.\"[69] On October 5, 2013, WB chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara said he wanted to get Wonder Woman in a film or on TV.[70] Shortly afterward, Paul Feig said he had pitched the studio an idea for Wonder Woman as an action-comedy film.[71][72] The studio then began to search for female directors to direct the film.[73] While Michelle MacLaren was the studio's initial choice to direct standalone film, and while she initially indicated interest,[74][75][76] she eventually left the project due to creative differences.[77] In 2015, Patty Jenkins accepted an offer to direct Wonder Woman,[78] based on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co-written by Heinberg and Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs.[79] Screenwriter Allan Heinberg's work had to be finished and rewritten by Jenkins and Geoff Johns after he had left to work on a TV show. Producer Charles Roven said that the duo had done \"a tremendous amount of collaboration\".[80] Johns was initially given screenplay credit by the studio but was left out in the official credits by the WGA.[81] Of this version, Gadot stated that, for a long time, people didn't know how to approach the story. When Patty and I had our creative conversations about the character, we realized that Diana can still be a normal woman, one with very high values, but still a woman. She can be sensitive. She is smart and independent and emotional. She can be confused. She can lose her confidence. She can have confidence. She is everything. She has a human heart.[82] This version of Wonder Woman acts as the character's origin story and serves as a spin-off, marking the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).[83][84] The character made her theatrical debut in the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, placing Wonder Woman in the 1910s and World War I—a departure from her comic book origins, where she supported the Allies during World War II.[85] Director Jenkins drew inspiration from William Moulton Marston's 1940s stories and George Perez's 1980s in which he modernized the character.[86] The film also incorporates elements from DC Comics' origin changes in The New 52 reboot, where Diana is the daughter of Zeus.[8][87] Jenkins cited Richard Donner's Superman (1978) as a significant influence on the film's tone and storytelling.[88] Jenkins noted that she faced pushback from the studio regarding her decision to make Wonder Woman vulnerable, as some questioned portraying the character with flaws rather than as purely strong or perfect. Jenkins emphasized that creating a relatable, multifaceted character was essential, citing The Hunger Games as a significant step in changing perceptions of female leads.[89] Gadot said that the movie is a \"coming-of-age story, it's about her become an adult, really. From a child to an adult, and understanding the complexities of life.\"[90] Casting [edit]I remember when I read in the news that Wonder Woman had been cast and my heart sank ... I'm sure we wouldn't have made the same choice. And then I started paying attention to her and watching her and looking at her and it was just unbelievable. Frankly, I think they did a better job than I could have because I don't know that I would have scoured the earth as hard to find her ... They were looking for all the same things I would have looked for—all the values that Wonder Woman stands for exuding from someone in an honest way and boy did they find it ... She shares every quality with Wonder Woman and that's no joke. It's one of those rare things. You need someone who can appear to be Wonder Woman on screen ... Every once in a while, there's superhero casting that transcends, because that person is so authentic to the character that it becomes identified with them, like Lynda Carter or Christopher Reeve. In late 2013, Zack Snyder cast Gal Gadot in the role of Wonder Woman for the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice over Élodie Yung and Olga Kurylenko,[92][93][94][95] Jaimie Alexander was also considered but declined due to her contract with Marvel.[96] Gadot had previously been offered the role of the Faora-Ul in Man of Steel (2013) but turned it down due to her pregnancy.[97] Gadot later signed a three-picture deal and received a base salary of $300,000 for the film itself.[98] Some criticized the casting, arguing that Gadot's Israeli background should have disqualified her from playing the role, which is often seen as an American symbol of freedom.[99] Others said she was too thin to portray the character, who traditionally is depicted as busty and muscular.[99][100] Gadot dismissed the backlash,[100] explaining she trained extensively to build muscle and move beyond her Fast & Furious image. She took lessons in swordsmanship, Kung Fu, kickboxing, capoeira, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, gaining 17 pounds. She said, \"I trained six hours a day for six months—gym, fight choreography, and horseback riding. It was more intense than the army.\"[99][101] Snyder later commented on his decision to cast Gadot, stating that he tested a \"bunch of actresses, as you can imagine. But the thing with Gal is that she's strong, she's beautiful and she's a kind person, which is interesting, but fierce at the same time. It's that combination of being fierce but kind at the same time that we were looking for.[102] Connie Nielsen was cast as Hippolyta after Charlize Theron turned down the role.[103] Nielsen recalled that Snyder pushed Jenkins to meet with her, despite Jenkins initially thinking she was too tough for the part. Nielsen flew to London just before Christmas and met Jenkins for lunch, where they quickly bonded, leading to her casting.[28] Nielsen went through a workout regimen for the film, saying \"I did six hours a day. You know, two hours of weight training, two hours of swords training and then two hours of horseback riding\".[28] Robin Wright was cast as Antiope. Wright said training for the film included riding, weights, martial arts, and eating 2,000–3,000 calories a day.[104] Chris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor,[13][105] and signed a multi-picture deal.[13] Pine initially had no interest in playing the role, feeling that it was \"second fiddle.\" However, after speaking with director Jenkins, his perspective changed. Pine recalled, \"I had no interest in playing the boyfriend, and it sounded like second fiddle... Then, in talking to Patty, the way she described it was, 'Forget the superhero of it all, this is a romance, this is Casablanca, that's the movie I want to make.' I was like, 'Oh, now that is very cool because when have you seen a superhero film that was a love story, ultimately? That had nothing to do with blowing shit up.\"[106] Pine worked out for the film and said, \"I got in great shape,\" but joked, \"I was wearing about 75 pounds of clothes. I made a mistake—getting in shape only to have it covered up.\"[107] Eugene Brave Rock was cast as Chief, blackfoot, he recalled thay he \"had no idea it was for Wonder Woman. I lost it when I showed up and I couldn't remember my lines. I didn't take it literally until a month later, I got a call saying I got the role and they wanted me to fly to London for a fitting.\"[108] Other cast members include, Lucy Davis's performance as Etta Candy is the first live-action cinematic portrayal of the character.[109] As well, Elena Anaya's performance as Doctor Poison is the cinematic debut of that character. Nicole Kidman was in negotiations for the role of Queen Hippolyta, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Big Little Lies.[110][111] Writing [edit]Gadot described Diana as having \"the heart of a human so she can be emotional, she's curious, she's compassionate, she loves people. And then she has the powers of a goddess. She's all for good, she fights for good.\"[82] She also said that Diana has \"many strengths and powers, but at the end of the day she's a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence\".[112] As to how her character is different from her appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Gadot said \"We go back 100 years to when she's more naive\", further explaining, \"She's this young idealist. She's pure. Very different to the experienced, super-confident, grown-up woman you've seen\".[113] Pine noted that, \"When I first read the script, it had elements of Romancing the Stone, kind of a very classic fish out of water. Two people that don't really bond well at first and they're butting heads and just fun, witty banter\".[15] Wright noted that the film's message was \"not just female empowerment; it's about love and justice. That's what the film is about. And what a great message to spread to our little ones.\"[114] Danny Huston who is playing Erich Ludendorff, stated the film as an anti-war film.[21] On the genre of the film, Huston said \"It's Greek mythology. It's the origin of story.\"[21] Brave Rock raised several concerns with Jenkins over the representation of his character in the film, particularly that he was not comfortable playing into stereotypes and that he was not keen on his character being simply known as \"Chief\". Jenkins responded by giving him some extra creative control over his character, which Brave Rock said was \"unprecedented\".[115] Design [edit]Wonder Woman features a reimagined costume by Lindy Hemming, building upon Michael Wilkinson's original design from Batman v Superman.[116] The updated suit retains key elements of Wonder Woman's classic look while modernizing it for practicality.[117] Hemming's design emphasizes strength and functionality, inspired by ancient Greek and Roman armor.[118] It includes leather skirts modeled after pteruges worn by Hoplite soldiers and gilded breastplates reflecting Amazonian warrior culture.[117] Hemming aimed to create empowering armor without veering into sexualization. She drew inspiration from sportswear, focusing on durability and flexibility to support the film's action sequences.[116] Collaborating with Whitaker Malem, she used body scanning technology to tailor the suit to Gadot's exact measurements. Whitaker recalls, \"We built around 160 costumes in total,\" highlighting the meticulous attention to detail that conveyed Diana's evolution from a princess on Themyscira to a warrior hero.[117] Jenkins envisioned their battle wear as distinct from traditional male armor, Jenkins explained \"to me, they shouldn't be dressed in armor like men, it should be different—authentic, real, and appealing to women.\" Together, Jenkins and Hemming crafted a look that showcased the Amazons' physical strength, with outfits highlighting their toned shoulders and legs. The designs balanced practicality with comic book tropes, including wrist braces and, notably, high heels. Jenkins defends the latter, calling it \"total wish-fulfillment,\" She adds, \"The warriors have flats for heavy fighting, but I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time—the same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body. That makes them feel like the hero they want to be. And my hero, in my head, has really long legs.\"[17] Filming [edit]The film was shot on 35mm,[119] with principal photography on the film began on November 21, 2015,[120][121] under the working title Nightingale.[122][123] Among the film sets were Lower Halstow, Kent,[124] and Australia House[125] in England and the Sassi di Matera,[126] Castel del Monte[126] and Camerota[127] in Southern Italy. Matthew Jensen was the director of photography,[128] filming in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.[129] Production in London concluded on March 13, 2016.[130] Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, England was also used as a filming location.[131][132] On March 20, 2016, filming was underway in Italy. In late April, filming took place at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where a Wayne Enterprises truck was spotted alongside Gadot.[133] Principal photography finished on May 9, 2016.[134] Jenkins and director of photography Matt Jensen said that the film's look was inspired by painter John Singer Sargent.[135] Jenkins said she shot the movie on film instead of digital video \"because there's a certain type of epic grander escapism that film gives you that you cannot – you will struggle very hard – to get that on video\".[136] Reshoots took place in November 2016, while Gadot was five months pregnant. A green cloth was placed over her stomach to edit out her pregnancy during post-production.[137] To find the perfect location to shoot the Amazon island of Themyscira, the birthplace of Wonder Woman herself, the film's producers searched all over the world, finally settling on the Cilentan Coast: a stretch of coastline on the Tyrrhenian Sea, located in the Province of Salerno in Southern Italy.[138] It was chosen because most beaches in the world that sit below big cliffs disappear beneath the tide for part of every day. Production designer Aline Bonetto and her location manager Charles Somers considered 47 countries and visited several of them before they found what they were looking for. Bonetto explained that, \"Italy had beautiful weather, a beautiful blue-green sea, not too much tide, not too much wave. Our effects team added some cliffs in post-production and it was the perfect way to go\".[139] The estuary at Lower Halstow in Kent is featured in the scene in which Diana arrives at a Belgian creek to make her way to the warfront.[140] Bill Westenhofer served as the visual effects supervisor for the film[141] and Martin Walsh served as editor.[128] Cinematography and visuals [edit]Jenkins wanted to make a \"classic, Richard Donner-style superhero movie— a tentpole of yesteryear\" film.[142] The visual design of the film emphasized vibrant colors and dynamic compositions, marking a departure from the darker tones of previous DC Extended Universe films like Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Jenkins and cinematographer Matthew Jensen drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including a photograph of singer-songwriter James Blunt with colored smoke in the background. Jenkins described the image as representing the \"colored-smoke thing\" she wanted to explore.[143] The film's diverse color palette played a key role in its storytelling. Themyscira, Wonder Woman's utopian homeland, was depicted with azure skies, verdant fields, and clear waters, symbolizing a paradise untouched by war. In contrast, London was designed with grays, blues, and cyans to reflect its industrial, polluted environment, aligning with Diana's line, \"It's hideous\". However, even in London, Jensen avoided complete desaturation, achieving a balance by filming under overcast winter light to create a soft patina.[143] Jenkins and Jensen deliberately avoided traditional period drama tropes, such as heavy filters, desaturation, and gauzy visuals. Instead, they opted for a sharp, clear look with a full-color spectrum, blending grit with vibrancy to maintain a modern feel.[144] However, historical and artistic references shaped the film's visual identity. Jenkins and Jensen studied the vibrant portraits of Edwardian painter John Singer Sargent's vibrant portraits, particularly those from around 1918, to create a period aesthetic without relying on muted tones. Inspiration also came from Wonder Woman comic runs, including the late-1980s work of George Pérez and the early-2000s art of Cliff Chiang and Matthew Wilson.[143] Jensen further referenced photographers like Inge Morath for vibrant color work and Annie Leibovitz for her natural skin tones against contrasting backgrounds.[144] The beach battle sequence between Amazons and German soldiers showcased the team's innovative approach to action cinematography. A standout shot involved a custom-built rig resembling a \"roller-coaster of pipe and tracks,\" designed to move the camera from a high vantage point down to ground level while capturing the action in slow motion. Despite challenges with the rig sinking into the sand, the sequence was successfully executed without relying heavily on CGI.[143] Jenkins's focus on color and individuality extended to the overall production philosophy. Unlike other franchise films that prioritize brand consistency, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. gave Jenkins and Jensen creative freedom, allowing them to craft a distinctive aesthetic that aligned with Wonder Woman's character and origin story. This approach contributed to Wonder Woman being celebrated as a visually unique entry in the DCEU.[143] Music [edit]On November 3, 2016, Rupert Gregson-Williams was hired to write and compose the film's music.[145][146] He was joined by Evan Jolly, Tom Howe,[147] Paul Mounsey,[148] and Andrew Kawczynski,[149] who provided additional music. The soundtrack was released on CD, digital and vinyl the same day as the film.[150] Australian musician Sia sang a song for the film, titled \"To Be Human\", featuring English musician Labrinth. Written by Florence Welch and Rick Nowels, the track is also featured on the soundtrack.[151] The soundtrack also features samples from Wonder Woman's theme \"Is She with You\" from the soundtrack for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL.[citation needed] Additional music featured in the film are: \"Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm\" by Clifford Grey and Nat Ayer and performed by Edgar Trevor and Cecil Cooper; \"Molly O'Morgan\" written by Fred Godfrey and Will Letters and performed by Ella Retford; \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\" written by Jack Judge and Harry Williams; \"Sous les ponts de Paris\" written by Jean Rodor and Vincent Scotto and performed by Lucienne Delyle; \"I'll Walk Beside You\" written by Edward Lockton and Alan Murray and performed by Ewen Bremner; \"Green Grow the Rushes, O\" written by Robert Burns and performed by Ewen Bremner; and \"Schatzwalzer Op. 4\" written by Johann Strauss II and performed by the Berlin String Quartet.[152] Marketing [edit]The success of the superhero television series Supergirl informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for Wonder Woman.[153] According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara, they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner, similar to how they did with Supergirl. O'Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series, which reportedly generated 5 million female superhero fans in one week.[153] They were then able to model over time and grow that audience leading up to the 15-months-later release of Wonder Woman.[153] Though neither the film nor the series are aimed exclusively at women, the latter's campaign gave them their first opportunity to begin collecting data about female superhero fans.[153] In May 2017, a promo for Wonder Woman was released during the season finale of Supergirl, featuring a remix of the song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" and Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) wearing Wonder Woman's boots.[154] The promo included an appearance by Lynda Carter, star of the 1970s Wonder Woman series, who plays the American president on Supergirl.[154] The costs for television advertisements for Wonder Woman were higher in comparison to that of previous DCEU film Suicide Squad (2016). Warner Bros. has spent over $3 million on advertisements for Wonder Woman, whereas they spent $2.6 million on advertisements for Suicide Squad.[155][156] Ticket selling site Fandango reported that Wonder Woman rounded the final leg of its marketing campaign as the most anticipated blockbuster of summer 2017, according to a poll conducted by 10,000 voters, the biggest survey in company history.[157] Separately, Fandango also found that 92% of people surveyed said that they were looking forward to seeing a film that features a standalone woman superhero and 87% wished Hollywood would make more women-led superhero films.[158] In May 2017, NASCAR driver Danica Patrick drove her No. 10 car with a Wonder Woman paint scheme at the Go Bowling 400 in Kansas and at the Monster Energy Open in Charlotte.[159] Release [edit]Theatrical [edit]Wonder Woman had its world premiere on May 25, 2017, at Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[160] The film's London premiere, which was scheduled to take place on May 31 at the Odeon Leicester Square, was canceled due to the Manchester Arena bombing.[161] The film had its Latin America premiere in Mexico City on May 27. It was released in most of the world, including in IMAX,[162] on June 2, 2017, after originally being scheduled for June 23.[163][164] Belgium, Singapore and South Korea received the film first, with May 31 openings.[165][166][167] On April 17, it was announced that Wonder Woman would be released in China on June 2, the same day as its North American release.[168] Box office [edit]Wonder Woman grossed $412.8 million in the United States and Canada and $411.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $824 million, against an estimated production budget of $120–150 million.[6] Estimates for the number the film needed to surpass internationally in order to cover its production and promotional costs and break even ranged from $300 million[169] to $460 million.[170] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $252.9 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it sixth on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[171] United States and Canada [edit]In May 2017, early tracking had Wonder Woman opening with $65–75 million and possibly as high as $105 million.[169][172][173][174][175] The film opened Friday, June 2, 2017, across 4,165 theaters and made $38.2 million on its opening day, including $3.7 million in IMAX. It was the biggest single-day gross for a woman-directed film, ahead of the $35.9 million opening Friday of Catherine Hardwicke's Twilight in 2008 and the biggest opening day for a woman-led comic book superhero film, ahead of Ghost in the Shell ($7 million).[176] This included $11 million it made from Thursday previews, also the best start for a film directed by a woman, surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey's (2015) $8.6 million which was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and the third-biggest of the year, behind Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Of that, $1.5 million came from IMAX screenings.[177][178] Earning a total of $103.3 million on its opening weekend, the film recorded a number of records: the biggest domestic opening of all time for a female director (surpassing previous record holder Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest DC Comics release without Batman or Superman (ahead of Constantine), the sixth-biggest non-sequel comic book superhero debut ever, as well as the sixth-biggest June debut weekend.[179] Its three-day opening alone made it the highest-grossi"
