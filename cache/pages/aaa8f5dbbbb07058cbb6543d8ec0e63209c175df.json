  "text": "Can someone explain the \"2S+\" part of LGBTQ2S+? I know less than a dozen people who identify as LGBTQ, but they only identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual. I don't know anyone who identifies as queer, 2S (2 spirited), + (whatever that means), CIS (I don't know what this is). I don't personally know any transgendered or transitioning individuals. So, please educated me on what these weird 2S+CIS non-binary labels mean for me, the average Joe six pack you meet on the street. Maybe even day why it's different from \"just\" gay, lesbian and bisexual."
