By Zoe Gowen Zoe Gowen After a notable obsession with yellow houses, historic homes, and glossy magazines as a child that lead to a degree in American Studies from Sewanee: University of the South followed by a jaunt through the Washington, DC art world, Zoë found her way as the Senior Home and Garden Editor with Southern Living. There she crisscrossed the region to produce inspiring interiors, entertaining, and holiday stories while also overseeing the Idea House franchise. After seeing more porches and Christmas trees than any other reasonable person can claim, she ventured out to pave new roads writing for various magazines and helping people bring magazine tearsheets to life inside private homes via interior decorating. Southern Living's editorial guidelines Updated on January 30, 2026 Close Losing a side wall in the kitchen almost doubled its size, allowing much more wiggle room in the revamped space. Credit: Robert Peterson; Styling: Francis Bailey Whether you're planning a complete kitchen overhaul or you're just looking for a few quick and easy updates, these creative kitchens are sure to inspire you. There are many different types of kitchens in the South. Some are white kitchens with subway tiles, brass accents, and Carrera marble countertops. Some kitchens are colorful and bold with wooden countertops, bright blue cabinetry, and polished nickel accents. Others are more modern kitchens with polished chrome and funky light fixtures. Regardless of what style you prefer, all of these different kitchen ideas will inspire you to take a leap and create a stunning kitchen in your own home. 35 Must-Have Ideas For Your Dream Kitchen 01 of 108 Make A Few High-Impact Moves A full-blown renovation wasn't in the cards for this St. Simons Island, Georgia, home, so designer Andrew Howard installed a hand-painted backsplash from Reptile Tiles, lanterns by Coleen & Company, and a Roman shade in Pindler’s Bentley fabric in Sprout. “You can have your kitchen transformed without ripping out your cabinets and appliances, and it will go from being a white box to this,” says the designer. “It’s a nice kind of compromise. 02 of 108 Incorporate Smart Storage Credit: Alison Gootee; Stylist: Jimmie Henslee; Design: Lisa Henderson In her family's Dallas home, designer Lisa Henderson forged a galley-style kitchen that prioritized efficiency, relying on the peninsula for additional storage and extra seating. 03 of 108 Make It Light Losing a side wall in the kitchen almost doubled its size, allowing much more wiggle room in the revamped space. Credit: Robert Peterson; Styling: Francis Bailey Installing additional windows flooded this historic Athens, Georgia, kitchen with more sun and created an opportunity for a truly lived-in kitchen. “We’ll eat at the island on busy school nights, and we can all fit!” says homeowner Kim Noland. Pendant lights wrapped in pleated fabric soften the space. 04 of 108 Lean on Blue And Green Credit: Alison Gootee; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller “I love to cook, so kitchens are fun for me to design. They seem to be the place everyone gravitates to,” says designer Jena Salmon, who washed her Dallas kitchen's cabinets in Farrow & Ball’s Calke Green (No. 34) and selected a ditzy floral print (Jouy by Thibaut) to cover the walls. 05 of 108 Opt For An Elevated Backsplash Credit: Jeff Herr Designer Mallory Mathison Glenn warmed up this Albany, Georgia, kitchen with a celadon tile backsplash and brass-and-glass shelves just right for displaying the homeowner's collection of white-and-blue ceramics. Add texture with stools in rattan or wicker to make a traditional kitchen like this one feel lived-in and modern. 06 of 108 Include Artful Elements Credit: Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller In this Fairhope, Alabama, kitchen, design studio March + May incorporated a combination of existing and newly purchased finds, with old bar stools cut down to counter height for the honed-granite island and a new-to-the-homeowners antique platter hung above the range as easy-to-clean art. 07 of 108 Focus On The View Credit: Alison Gootee; Styling: Jessica Holtam; Design: Jackson Warren Interiors Given this Perdido Key kitchen's spectacular location on the water, preserving sight lines was a must. To that end, the designers moved the range to the perimeter and installed a white wooden hood that all but disappears into its surroundings. To better accommodate a crowd, they shifted the island’s orientation, allowing them to nearly double its size. 08 of 108 Go All-In On Tile Credit: Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Lindsey Ellis Beatty Because her Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, kitchen didn't have any windows, designer and homeowner Hannon Doody manufactured a sense of light by covering the walls, backsplash, and hood with a neutral glossy tile. 09 of 108 Create An Outdoor Connection Credit: Alison Gootee; Styling: Kate Malpeli To ensure this English farmhouse-inspired kitchen was far from dark and closed off, interior designer Laura Jenkins took it a step further than just a plethora of windows. A bi-fold window opens up to the backyard with a bar top extension and barstool seating on the outdoor patio.

A custom kitchen island was built to resemble a vintage find that was coated in lead paint, and refurbished pendant lights were sourced from Nomadic Trading Co. in Durham, North Carolina.

In this kitchen, a large antique French white oak table was used in lieu of a traditional island. 12 of 108 Statement Maker Credit: LAUREY W. GLENN White kitchens are lovely, but they're also an exciting place to take a design risk while still prioritizing practicality. In this kitchen, the length and height of one wall is covered with Popham Design’s sea glass-colored Goa tile. It’s a functional move too because the tile protects a hard-working wall from cooking chaos. Practicality also dictated the lighting. Rather than pendants over the island, which would have underscored the room’s lack of symmetry and blocked the view, this kitchen features ceramic flush mounts from Cedar and Moss.

All of the living areas connect, so to avoid cluttering the open floor plan with too many cabinets, almost everything—from flatware to everyday dishes—is well organized and stowed away in drawers. This also makes it easy for guests of all ages to access kitchen essentials 16 of 108 Keep It Natural Credit: Hector Manuel Sanchez Designer Catherine Branstetter renovated her 1920s Tudor cottage, hoping to keep the original charm. To do this, she kept a very natural color palette to highlight some of the original wood. Tour This 1920s Nashville Tudor Tailored For A Growing Family 17 of 108 English Country Inspired Credit: Brian Woodcock Southern farmhouse style kitchens have deep roots in classic English countryside style kitchens, and this kitchen shows that tie perfectly. The vertical plank cabinetry gives that country feel, and the bright openness of the design makes for a stunning, efficient layout.

Credit: Brie Williams “I love how sunny it is,” designer Molly Williams says of her compact kitchen, which she painted the cabinetry with a fresh coat of Sherwin-Williams’ Extra White (SW 7006) and real brass hardware to make the space even brighter. She also added pattern with Magnolia’s French Ticking Wallpaper and added bamboo blinds to allow natural light to filter in. This North Carolina Home Is Like A Life-Size Treasure Box 19 of 108 Fresh Start Credit: Alexandra Rowley To avoid the expense of relocating the plumbing, the homeowner kept the room's original footprint but updated the cabinetry, appliances, and fixtures. He replaced the dated wood cabinets, which hung near the ceiling and were difficult to reach, with easy-to-access open shelving and Shaker-style lower cabinets—all painted crisp white. A ceramic subway-tile backsplash and sleek marble countertops complete the monochromatic look. Open shelving holds everyday basics; lower cabinets store pots and pans. 20 of 108 Aim For Simplicity Credit: Brian Woodcock; Styling: Page Mullins Designer Allison Allen ditched the original mustard wallpaper in favor of all-white everything, except for a few choice pops of blue in the pendants (by Mark D. Sikes for Hudson Valley Lighting), the striped stool cushions, and the island. “I think kitchens should feel very clean,” she says. “I don’t like to have a lot going on.” The deep farmhouse sink tucked below the windows is both practical and pretty. “You can do just about anything in a big sink! Set flower arrangements in there, or bathe your dog,” suggests the designer. 21 of 108 Make It Moody Credit: Joseph De Leo If you're looking for a dramatic kitchen without feeling too kitschy or dark, incorporating mood lighting is a great way to achieve this. This kitchen features a group of ceramic light fixtures above the sink that produces a low light to create a moody atmosphere among the dark cabinets. 22 of 108 Go Green Credit: Laurey W. Glenn Green is the color of freshness and nature — two characteristics perfect for a space revolving around food and dining. This kitchen uses two different shades of green to create a lovely contrast and an overall bright and inviting look in the space. 30 Cottage-Style Kitchens That Will Make You Feel At Home 23 of 108 Build Only What You Need Credit: HECTOR MANUEL SANCHEZ STYLING BY: HOLLY SMITH Laura Kay knew her home was in need of a once-in-a-century sort of update, so she took on the challenge. “The kitchen had undergone a 1990s renovation with lots of elaborate cabinetry, several different granites, and an unusual gravel floor insert used for growing houseplants,” says Kay. She stripped out the old cabinets for simple Shaker-style versions, added a new island with a sink and dishwasher, and painted the floors. She enhanced the original range and brick hood by installing wooden corbels ordered from Van Dyke’s Restorers beneath the hood. “The smooth transition to the wall and countertop makes a big difference,” she says. Opposite those, the homeowner kept her pantry nearby but disguised it as two tall cabinets flanking the open shelving.

Tired of white kitchens, she drenched the entire space in a custom deep, dark green in a glossy lacquered finish. Her collection of white dishes and serving pieces, an impressive La Cornue range, and a white subway-tile backsplash add interest and break up the swaths of green. 25 of 108 A Modern Upgrade Credit: Photo: Laurey W. Glenn We called our kitchen 'the time warp' because it looked like it hadn't been touched since the 1960s,\" says homeowner Jessica Thuston. \"The matching yellow laminate floors, cabinets, and countertops—I have a feeling it was pretty great back in its day.\" However, fast-forward 50 years, and this space was in major need of an update. \"We loved the size and basic layout, but everything else had to go,\" Jessica says. 26 of 108 House Of Blues Credit: Brie Williams Styling: Jennifer Berno Decleene As she often hosts guests, the owner of this house wanted a spacious kitchen for harmonious cooking and mingling, so she anchored the room with an island topped by a large slab of Silestone Calacatta Gold quartz in a suede finish. The cabinets are painted a calm shade of blue (Sherwin-Williams’ Krypton, SW 6247) that she spotted online years prior and knew she wanted to incorporate. Matte white Café appliances finish the space with a custom look. This North Carolina Lake Home Was Built For The Views 27 of 108 Stylish Functionality Credit: Photo: Laurey W. Glenn Feeling a bit confined in their dated Hannibal, Missouri, kitchen, Lynn and Bobby Boland wanted a complete overhaul. Without adding an inch of square footage, designer Amie Corley gave them the stylish, family-friendly kitchen they were hoping for. 28 of 108 Keep It Original Credit: Photo: Helen Norman, Styling: Rebecca Omweg Windows in the kitchen open to the central hallway and reflect original dogtrot architecture. 29 of 108 Vintage Vibes Credit: Photo: Laurey W. Glenn A small but efficient island holds refrigerator drawers and a bookcase for cookbooks. Painted deep gray to contrast with the lighter color of the cabinets and topped with marble, it feels vintage and perhaps even original to the house. At the end sits an antique tea table where the couple eats breakfast. A Cape Cod Cottage Gets a Makeover 30 of 108 Green With Envy Credit: Photo: Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Matthew Gleason The sage green kitchen cabinetry has generous space for dinnerware and pantry items, and a fossilized countertop surface adds a sense of history to the space. 31 of 108 Natural Instinct Credit: Photo: Chris Luker Combined with a classic farmhouse table and chairs, the clean-lined bench—attached to the island and painted the same color as the cabinets—saves valuable floorspace. 32 of 108 L-Shaped Love Credit: Laurey W.

I just wanted something that we could really use.\" For her family, that meant updating a 1923 home (without sacrificing its charm) to include details like a banquette in the kitchen to share meals, do homework, and more. 36 of 108 Lead With Your Lifestyle Credit: Chris Edwards; Styling: Kendra Surface For designer Liz Carroll, each portion of her once-abandoned Wilmington ranch needed to suit her family's needs. \"After we opened up the kitchen, we had room to add a bar long enough to seat our family. We can now see the backyard from the kitchen sink, which is a must for a mom of three,\" says Carroll. Floating wood shelves, quartz countertops, glass sconces (from Visual Comfort), shiplap walls, and lower cabinets painted Benjamin Moore's Iron Mountain (2134-30) contribute to a light and airy feel.

The island is painted Farrow & Ball's Green Blue, No. 84, but the room's details, like an Italian Murano bubble glass chandelier and a custom lacquered table, create a canvas for entertaining.

Since the kitchen needed a total gut, she hid some budget-friendly elements, like big-box store cabinetry, in its design. She painted the original wood-paneled walls bright white (PPG's Delicate White, PPG1001-1). \"You can use art to make a kitchen feel a bit more lived-in,\" she says.

Sikes for Hudson Valley Lighting bring in the color. The One Home Renovation Mistake I Wish I Never Made 46 of 108 Twist On Tradition Credit: Brie Williams; Styling: Page Mullins North Carolina residents Megan and Matt Lineberger hired general contractor Tom Martin and Son, architect Mark Maresca, and designer Cortney Bishop to craft a Charleston-style beach home on Kiawah Island. \"The kitchen was created to read as an old cookhouse that was adjoined to the main home over time,\" says Maresca. \"The lines and millwork are simpler, but the playful palette enlivens those 'old' bones.\" This Kiawah Island Beach Home Is Designed With Comfort And Style In Mind 47 of 108 Southern Charmer Credit: Photo: Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Elly Poston Cooper Designer Allison Allen revived a neglected home her husband Beau inherited in a matter of just two months. The couple brought the kitchen into the modern era by removing soffits, upper cabinets, and asbestos-contaminated linoleum floors. Allison kept the decor simple and white to stick to the strict timetable of the renovation. What was her best time-saving move? Ordering a readymade island from Wayfair that looked similar to her cabinets and topping it with Carrara marble. Overhead, she added interest to the ceiling with beaded board. 48 of 108 Laidback Natural Credit: Robbie Caponetto; Styling: Kendra Surface Designer Lauren Liess was inspired by the gorgeous mountain surroundings of our 2020 Idea House in Asheville, North Carolina, when taking on the interiors. In the kitchen, terra-cotta tiles (Folk Bouquet from her line by Architectural Ceramics) add a patterned background for elements like natural wood beams and a chimney-style range hood, which adds a historical element. 2020 Idea House: A Dreamy Blue Ridge Mountain Hideaway 49 of 108 Breaking With Trends Credit: Laurey W.

The entire home has as a calming, laid-back feel, which carries over to the kitchen. \"We wanted to do something other than painted cabinets,\" says McBride, who took inspiration from the cottage's light hardwood floors when she settled on the revamped kitchen's slightly more contemporary white oak cabinets. A local craftsperson built and stained them a honey-blond hue that complements the floors. 50 of 108 The Contemporary Farmhouse Credit: Alison Gootee; Styling: Matthew Gleason Homeowners Jamie and Russell Braden stumbled upon their dream home (in need of some TLC) in a 1907 farmhouse in tiny Brenham, Texas. Designer Marie Flanigan helped blend classic farmhouse style with a contemporary touch. To keep things interesting in the mostly white house, Flanigan used bold colors and materials like dark beams, shiny metallics, and pops of rich navy in the kitchen.

Designer Allison Elebash was trusted with bridging new and old within the home's interiors. In the kitchen, the addition (including the main bedroom suite and the great room) joins the original structure. She eased the transition by applying marble, an of-the-era material, in fresh ways, like as the waterfall island and slab backsplash. \"We knew that whole back wall would become a focal point, so it had to be an interesting design element,\" Elebash says of the range wall. It's framed by two doorways topped with historically appropriate transom windows that boost the exchange of light and add to the room's character. A Thoughtful Renovation Preserves The Beauty And Character Of This Sullivan's Island Home 53 of 108 The Mid-Century Modern Kitchen Credit: Molly Culver Designer Shannon Eddings' entire renovation began with a desire to replace the backsplash in her 1950s kitchen, but her husband convinced her to go all in on a transformation. The final product is light and modern with a touch of retro whimsy. In the kitchen, gray-green cabinets (in Benjamin Moore's Silver Sage, 506) and quartz countertops are accented by brass hardware from Schoolhouse, a modern Brizo faucet, and custom brass edging on the marble-wrapped hood. She painted all the doors Benjamin Moore's Odessa Pink (HC-59) as a nod to her husband's West Texas roots. 54 of 108 Maintaining Character Credit: Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Shannon Gini Atlanta designer Amy Morris helped remodel this 1940s Athens, Georgia, split-level while still retaining its character. The homeowners wanted to open up the kitchen for ample entertaining space and a large island, but that didn't mean taking away the entire history of the space. An archway that separates the space from the neighboring living room was directly inspired by a 1940s feature that framed the original foyer. \"It was one of my favorite details in the entire home, so we knew we had to replicate it,\" says homeowner Bethany Taylor.

Tongue-and-groove paneling on the walls and ceiling is another old beach house detail since it handles humidity better than plaster. 20 Best Coastal Design Tips From The Pros 58 of 108 A Clean Slate Credit: Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor Kerri Goldfarb and Mia Brous (the designers behind the hit home boutique Madre in Dallas) created their personal friend's dream home with cheery hues and timeless style.

Because she prioritized a cozy breakfast nook in the kitchen, she wasn't able to configure the island so it was perfectly symmetrical in the space. She tried to make everything look balanced by aligning the island's sink with the range and hood and was strategic about lighting. \"Rather than having a pair of large pendants centered on the island, I hung an overall grid of small ones from The Home Depot to light the kitchen evenly,\" she says.

From the kitchen cabinetry to the playroom decor, the timeless color combo of black and white makes more than a dozen appearances in this home. \"I love that this scheme is simultaneously casual and glam, classic and fresh,\" she says. 74 of 108 Cabin Fever Credit: Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Frances Bailey A couple renovating a 1,400-square-foot 1950s Cabin in the Spectacular Shenandoah Valley turned to Julie Dixon and Keith Scott of Charlottesville-based Rosney Co. Architects. Creating a home that felt \"Western style\" was an important part of the project. The countertops and backsplash are made of Alberene Soapstone quarried in Schuyler, Virginia. \"It fits in with the rustic aesthetics of the cabin,\" notes Scott, who used wood (kiln-dried to kill bugs) from an old barn on the property to construct the cabinets and the window surrounds. 75 of 108 Take Cues From The Coast Blogger Julia Berolzheimer's Lowcountry cottage is as breezy as its coastal location. The focal point of the kitchen is a La Cornue range with a tall patterned backsplash of Tabarka Studio tile that matches the pale blue cabinets (Farrow & Ball's Parma Gray No. 27).

Glenn; Styling: Lizzie Cullen Cox A run-down cabin made a comeback as a relaxing retreat in Highlands, North Carolina, thanks to designer Whitney McGregor, who's drawn to fixer-uppers. \"For investment properties, I look for things that I can keep and use, because I like to save in one place so I can spend in another,\" McGregor explains. Holding onto the existing cabinetry and hardware meant she could splurge on new flooring after finding water damage behind the dishwasher. She reimagined the original black-and-white checkerboard pattern using marble and pulled inspiration from European-style freestanding kitchens: replacing the upper cabinets with open shelving, rolling in a stainless steel island (topped with salvaged butcher block) for extra prep space, and hanging a pair of rise-and-fall pendants.
