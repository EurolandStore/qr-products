Embracing the best of its Spanish and American influences, the culture exudes confidence and joy. You’ll find imposing 16th-century fortresses and vibrant street art, as well as a rich culinary scene, rolling coffee plantations, and rum distilleries. Everywhere you go, you’ll be captivated by music, from the sensual beat of salsa to cumbia, merengue, and the local genre, bomba. Cruises to and from Puerto Rico will reveal the island’s natural beauty, too. The dense rainforest and tumbling waterfalls of El Yunque National Park are an easy drive from San Juan, while at the Escambrón Marine Park, you can swim among sea turtles and colorful fish. There are beaches for sun-lovers and beaches for surfers, as well as hiking, kayaking, and zip-lining for the adventurous. Little wonder that the locals here seem so cheerful. Explore this enchanting island on a Caribbean cruise with Celebrity. Puerto Rico is endowed with exceptional natural beauty, from endless white sand beaches to rugged mountains and rainforest. Visit El Yunque National Park, the only tropical forest in the U.S., where jungle trails reveal massive tree roots, giant ferns, tumbling waterfalls, and cool rock pools. The coast is fringed with mangroves teeming with life, a dream for birdwatching enthusiasts. Join a starlit kayaking tour to marvel at Mosquito Bay, one of the brightest bioluminescent bays in the world. Partly encircled by 16th-century walls, Old San Juan is an enchanting and walkable neighborhood. Brightly colored houses with painted balconies and flower-filled patios line the cobblestone streets, which lead to leafy plazas and 16th-century churches. Art galleries sit side-by-side with cool, boho boutiques, while inviting bars and cafés serve fresh-ground coffee and ice-cold daiquiris. You’ll find a lively culinary scene all over Puerto Rico. Try local specialties, which include fresh fish, seafood paella, mofongo (mashed green plantain stuffed with anything from crab meat to chicken), and lechón asado, slow-roasted pork. Do as the locals do and have a quesito with your coffee—a puff pastry tube stuffed with sweetened cheese and drizzled with honey or chocolate. Join a rum distillery tour to learn how rum is matured in barrels, followed by a tasting. Celebrity offers numerous ways to explore Puerto Rico. You could sail round-trip from either Fort Lauderdale or Miami, or join a Panama Canal cruise between San Diego and San Juan.
