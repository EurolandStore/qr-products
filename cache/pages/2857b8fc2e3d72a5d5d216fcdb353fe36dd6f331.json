Is there anything better than the delicious duo of rich milk chocolate and smooth peanut butter? We think not. REESE'S Peanut Butter Cups begin with roasting fresh peanuts for REESE'S one-of-a-kind peanut butter. The peanut butter and milk chocolate are then dropped and pressed into a mold that gives REESE'S Cups their iconic shape. REESE'S Peanut Butter Cups were created by Harry Burnett (H.B.) Reese in 1928. H.B. Reese was a former employee of the Hershey Chocolate Company when he invented REESE'S peanut butter chocolate candy. The REESE'S product line includes over 100 candy bars, spreads, cookies, and cereals, including REESE'S Cups made with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white creme in a variety of sizes. The correct way to say REESE’S is “ree-siz,” not “ree-sees.” The best way to remember is to think about REESE’S PIECES Candy because “REESE’S” rhymes with “pieces.” REESE'S Plant Based Oat Chocolate Confection & Peanut Butter Candy Bars are vegan. All other REESE'S products are not vegan. REESE’S Candy is made by The Hershey Company. In 1956, H.B. Reese’s six sons took over the family business and later sold it to The Hershey Company in 1963. REESE'S Candy contains chocolate, and therefore should not be consumed by dogs. If you suspect that your dog has consumed chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately. There are 100+ REESE’S products labeled as gluten free. Always refer to each package for current ingredients and allergen statements to make an informed decision about Hershey products. If you have additional questions about a specific product, contact Customer Service or explore our gluten free labeled Hershey products."
