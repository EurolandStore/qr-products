  "text": "Ponce is a city in Puerto Rico located on the southern coast. Ponce is also known as La Perla del Sur and La Ciudad Señorial. It is the second-most populated city on the island, only after the capital San Juan. I grew up in Peñuelas, a small city west of Ponce. Visiting Ponce’s colonial center, historical landmarks, and museums was part of my childhood. In this article, I will cover the 25 best things to do in Ponce, Puerto Rico: The Ponce Art Museum is a must-stop when visiting the city. It is the most prestigious museum in Puerto Rico and one of the most recognized in the Caribbean. It is home to the Flaming June, a famous Victorian painting, and a permanent collection of 4,500 pieces.

For those with an adventurous spirit, a day trip to the island of Caja de Muertos will not disappoint. Caja de Muertos got its name from its coffin shape. It’s a natural reserve known for its pristine beaches, beautiful reefs, dry forest, and turtle nests. Visits by tour operators have not been reactivated after the hurricanes and earthquakes, so renting a boat charter is the best option.

Besides its magnificent architecture, you’ll also find stained glass art, statues, and a gorgeous pipe organ. It’s located in the middle of Plaza Las Delicias just behind the Parque de Bombas. For those craft beer fans, Papa Rupe Brewing is a must. This brewery will take you to the late 1800s. It’s located in a historic house that belonged to Thomas Armstrong Toro, one of the most important figures in the formation of Ponce’s Golden Age.
