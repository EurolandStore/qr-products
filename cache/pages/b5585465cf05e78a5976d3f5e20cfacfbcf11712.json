  "text": "Sage Advice Compendium The Sage Advice Compendium collects questions and answers about the rules of Dungeons & Dragons (fifth edition). The document’s version number changes when substantive additions or revisions have been made to the text. Rules References The fifth edition of D&D has three core rulebooks: Errata Errata have been issued for certain fifth edition books and are available at the following location: Sage Advice & Errata. Official Rulings Official rulings on how to interpret rules are made here in the Sage Advice Compendium. A Dungeon Master adjudicates the game and determines whether to use an official ruling in play. The DM always has the final say on rules questions. The public statements of the D&D team, or anyone else at Wizards of the Coast, are not official rulings; they are advice. Compiled Answers Sage Advice answers that are relevant to the current state of the rules are compiled here. The Role of Rules Why even have Sage Advice when a DM can just make a ruling? Rules are a big part of what makes D&D a game, rather than simply improvised storytelling. The game’s rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use. The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unwieldy. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we took for fifth edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we celebrate the DM as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don’t. In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions—some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn’t clear or when one rule seems to contradict another. Dealing with those situations is where Sage Advice comes in. It doesn’t replace a DM’s adjudication. Just as the rules do, this FAQ is meant to give DMs, as well as players, tools for tuning the game according to their tastes. We often approach rules questions from one to three different perspectives. RAW “Rules as written”—that’s what RAW stands for. When we dwell on the RAW interpretation of a rule, we’re studying what the text says in context, without regard to the designers’ intent. The text is forced to stand on its own. When we consider a rule, we start with this perspective; it’s important for us to see what you see, not what we wished we’d published or thought we’d published. RAI Some of you are especially interested in knowing the intent behind a rule. That’s where RAI comes in: “rules as intended.” This approach is all about what the designers meant when they wrote something. In a perfect world, RAW and RAI align perfectly, but sometimes the words on the page don’t succeed at communicating the designers’ intent. Or perhaps the words succeed with one group of players but not with another. When we write about the RAI interpretation of a rule, we pull back the curtain and let you know what the D&D team meant when writing that rule. RAF Regardless of what’s on the page or what the designers intended, D&D is meant to be fun, and the DM is the ringmaster at each game table. The best DMs shape the game on the fly to bring the most delight to their players. Such DMs aim for RAF, “rules as fun.” We expect DMs to depart from the rules when running a campaign or when seeking the greatest happiness for a certain group of players. We recommend a mix of RAW, RAI, and RAF! Ability Checks Are attack rolls and saving throws basically specialized ability checks? They aren’t. Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are all different kinds of D20 Tests that can be made during a game of D&D. As such, all three share certain similarities: rolling a d20, being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage, adding modifiers, and comparing the total to a target number. But ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are each distinct from the other. If something in the game affects one, such as the Guidance spell, the other two aren’t affected unless the rules specifically say so. A game rule that affects D20 Tests affects all three. Can you get a Critical Hit on an ability check? Ability checks don’t score Critical Hits. Attack rolls do. Is a 1 on an ability check an automatic failure? Rolling a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw is not an automatic failure. A 1 is an automatic miss for an attack roll. Adventuring If I’m hidden and a creature with Blindsight or Truesight sees me, am I still hidden? No. Being hidden is a game state that gives you the Invisible condition. If a creature finds you, you’re no longer hidden and lose that condition, as explained in the Hide action (see appendix C of the Player’s Handbook). The Stunned condition no longer prevents you from moving. Is that change intentional? Yes. We have intentionally increased the differences between the Stunned and Paralyzed conditions, with Stunned now allowing you to move. Does all magical Darkness block Darkvision? Magical Darkness blocks Darkvision only if the rules text for a particular instance of Darkness says it does. For example, the Darkness spell specifies that Darkvision can’t see through it. That obstruction is a feature of the spell, not a feature of magical Darkness in general. Is there a hard limit on how many Short Rests characters can take in a day, or is this purely up to the DM to decide? The only hard limit on the number of Short Rests you can take is the number of hours in a day. In practice, you’re also limited by time pressures in the story and foes interrupting. Are extradimensional spaces, such as a demiplane or the space created by Rope Trick, considered to be on a different plane of existence? An extradimensional space (aka an extraplanar space) is outside other planes. Therefore, if you’re on the Material Plane and your foe is in an extradimensional space, the two of you aren’t on the same plane of existence. (See chapter 6 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.) How do I tell if something in the game is magical? Game text explicitly states if an effect is magical. Effects created by spells and magic items are always magical. See “Magical Effect” in appendix C of the Player’s Handbook. What’s an example of an effect that can reduce Exhaustion? The Greater Restoration spell can reduce Exhaustion. What happens after level 20? Is there a cap to character levels? The highest level a character can reach is level 20. The “Bonus Feats at Level 20” sidebar in chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook provides some ideas for how DMs can use feats as a form of advancements for level 20 characters. The Frightened condition says “while the source of its fear is within line of sight.” Does that mean you have Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks even if the source is imperceptible but you have a clear line to its space? No. If you can’t see something, it’s not within your line of sight. Speaking of “line of sight,” the game uses the English meaning of the term, which has no special meaning in the rules. Combat Can you delay your turn and take it later in the round? No. When it’s your turn, you either do something or you don’t. If you want to wait to act in response to something, take the Ready action. (See appendix C of the Player’s Handbook.) I have a readied action. Can I stop readying to take an Opportunity Attack? Or does the Ready action take a full-round commitment? Think of the Ready action as a preparatory action rather than a commitment. By taking the Ready action, you’re giving your character access to a tailor-made Reaction to use in a given circumstance. However, you’re not bound to take that readied Reaction. As combat continues, you can decide to take this readied Reaction—or, if plans change, you can take any other Reaction you might have access to, such as an Opportunity Attack. But remember that you have only one Reaction. Taking an Opportunity Attack means you won’t be able to take that readied Reaction, so choose which Reaction you take carefully. Can a Bonus Action be used as an action or vice versa? For example, can a Bard use a Bonus Action to grant a Bardic Inspiration die and an action to cast Healing Word? No. Actions and Bonus Actions aren’t interchangeable. In the example, the Bard could use Bardic Inspiration or Healing Word on a turn, not both. Can a flying creature without the hover trait stay in one place while airborne, or does it need to move each round? A flier that lacks the hover trait can stay aloft without moving each round. Can you move through the space of a Prone enemy? You can move through the space of an enemy only if that enemy (A) has the Incapacitated condition, (B) is a Tiny creature, or (C) is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. The Prone condition doesn’t override this. Does travel pace apply to movement in combat or just when traveling? The travel pace rule doesn’t apply in combat. If you have a feature like Cunning Action or Step of the Wind, can you take the Dash action more than once on your turn? If you can take the Dash action as a Bonus Actions, nothing in the rules prevents you from taking the Dash action with your regular action too. The same principle holds when you use a feature like Action Surge; you could use both of your actions to take the Dash action. My Rogue/Wizard can get a Bonus Action to Dash by using Cunning Action, and I can cast Expeditious Retreat on myself to get a Bonus Action to Dash. Do I get two Bonus Actions to Dash? No. You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn. If you have two or more ways to use a Bonus Action, you must choose which one (if any) you want to employ on your turn. If you use the Help action to distract a foe, do you have to stay within 5 feet of it for the action to work? No, you can take the action and then move away. The action itself is what grants Advantage to your ally, not your staying next to the foe. If I’m hidden and become unhidden when I shoot an arrow at a target, does hiding again require an action? Without a special ability, hiding in combat requires the Hide action. If I use the Ready action to deal damage to someone who’s moving, do I deny the target the rest of its movement? Dealing damage to a moving target doesn’t halt its movement unless the damage is accompanied by an ability that stops movement. Things like the Sentinel feat give you such an ability. Reducing a moving creature to 0 Hit Points is also usually an effective way to stop it! Can you use the Ready action to take the Attack action on someone else’s turn and then combine the Charger feat with it? No. When you take the Ready action, you can either move up to your Speed or take a defined action as your Reaction. The Charger feat’s Charge Attack benefit relies on both moving and taking the Attack action on the same turn. For readying a spell or another action, does the target have to be in range? Your target must be within range when you take a readied action, not when you first take the Ready action to ready it. How does readying a spell work? Do you lose your spell slot if the trigger never occurs? When you take the Ready action to ready a spell, you immediately expend any resources used to cast said spell, including any spell slot. You don’t get any of these resources back if the trigger never occurs. See appendix C of the Player’s Handbook. Can a readied action occur during an enemy’s triggering action, such as between its first and second attacks when it uses Multiattack? A readied action occurs immediately after its trigger. If you defined the trigger as an attack, your action happens after that attack. How does a Reach weapon work with Opportunity Attack? An Opportunity Attack is triggered when a creature you can see moves beyond your reach. If you want to make an Opportunity Attack with a Reach weapon, such as a Glaive or a Halberd, you can do so when a creature leaves the reach you have with that weapon. For example, if you’re wielding a Halberd, a creature that is right next to you could move 5 feet away without triggering an Opportunity Attack. If that creature tries to move an additional 5 feet—leaving your 10-foot reach—the creature then triggers an Opportunity Attack. Can a Blinded creature make an Opportunity Attack? An Opportunity Attack is triggered when a creature that you can see leaves your reach. If you can’t see an enemy, you can’t make an Opportunity Attack against it. Creatures with Blindsight are an exception to this rule, because that ability lets those creatures “see” within a certain radius. Can an Opportunity Attack be used to make a grapple or a shove? Yes. When you make an Opportunity Attack, one of your options is making an Unarmed Strike. You can still choose to use the Grapple and Shove options of this Unarmed Strike. If a creature is Grappled, can it still attack and use its special abilities? The Grappled condition limits movement, not attacks, spellcasting, and the like. That said, many grappling abilities, such as a Giant Octopus’s Tentacles attack, also deliver effects like the Restrained condition. Does a grapple or shove trigger a Battle Master Fighter’s Riposte? No. Many game effects specify triggering when you are hit or missed by an attack roll; the Grapple and Shove options of an Unarmed Strike don’t use attack rolls. However, many monsters have special attacks that can grapple or shove a creature as part of its effect on a hit. If such a creature misses a Battle Master Fighter with an attack roll, the Battle Master Fighter could then use Riposte. Say I grapple you, then I have the Prone condition. Are we now Prone together? No. A creature you’re grappling isn’t Prone if you have the Prone condition. You’re now holding on to the creature while you are Prone. Target at range caught in melee combat—does that target get some kind of cover, or do I get Disadvantage? Your target has Half Cover if another creature is between you and the target. Can damage be reduced to 0 by Resistance or another form of damage reduction? Yes, it is possible to reduce damage to 0 but no lower. A dragon uses a breath weapon against me. I succeed on the save, and I have Resistance to the damage. Do I take only one-quarter of the damage? Yes, because Resistance is applied after all other general adjustments to damage. If you succeed on a save and still take damage, that damage is halved if you have the right Resistance. Is the intent that only Melee weapon attacks can knock foes Unconscious, or can melee spell attacks as well? If you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can knock the creature out. That melee attack isn’t restricted to weapons. Even a melee spell attack can be used to knock a creature out. Can a non-Battle Master attempt to disarm someone? The Disarming Attack maneuver is designed for the Battle Master Fighter, but any character can try to disarm a foe. Such an attempt would fall under improvising an action not detailed by the rules and would be up to your DM to adjudicate. Can I make an attack with a Light weapon, then draw a second weapon with my other hand and qualify to make the extra attack of the Light property? Yes. The only requirement for the Light property’s extra attack is that it’s made with a different Light weapon. Multiclassing Would a temporary stat bump fulfill a multiclass prerequisite, or does the base score have to meet the requirement? Your base score, not a temporary score, has to meet a multiclassing prerequisite. When multiclassing, do you get the cantrips from all your classes? If any of your classes grants you cantrips, you get all of them. Do you gain proficiency in more saving throws when multiclassing? When you gain a level in a new class through multiclassing, you gain only the traits listed under the “As a Multiclass Character” section in the class’s introduction. This does not include saving throws. However, if a class grants additional proficiencies or training through one of its features, you also gain those, regardless if the class is your first. For example, if you gain a level in Cleric and choose the Protector option of the Divine Order feature, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor, and if you’re a Gloom Stalker Ranger and gain the Iron Mind feature, you gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws—even if Cleric or Ranger respectively isn’t your first class. Can a Barbarian/Fighter (Battle Master) use maneuvers while raging? Nothing in the Barbarian’s Rage feature precludes the use of maneuvers. Can a Rogue/Monk use Sneak Attack with Unarmed Strikes? The Sneak Attack feature works with a weapon that has the Finesse or Ranged property. An Unarmed Strike isn’t a weapon, so it doesn’t qualify. In contrast, a Rogue/Monk can use Sneak Attack with a Monk weapon, such as a Shortsword or a Dagger, that has one of Sneak Attack’s required properties. A Wizard multiclasses into a Sorcerer with the Wild Magic Sorcery subclass. Do spells cast from their spellbook trigger Wild Magic Surge if they are on the Sorcerer spell list, or do they have to gain them from Sorcerer to trigger? From the multiclassing rules: “Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes.” This rule means only the spells prepared as part of your Sorcerer class features trigger Wild Magic Surge. Class Features General When you use Extra Attack, do you have to use the same weapon for all the attacks? Extra Attack imposes no limitation on what you use for the attacks. You can use regular weapons, improvised weapons, Unarmed Strike, or a combination of these options for the attacks. However, you must still follow the rules for equipping and unequipping weapons as part of the Attack action. Barbarian For the Barbarian’s Reckless Attack, do you grant Advantage to all enemies, or only to the target of your attack? If you use the Barbarian’s Reckless Attack, all attack rolls have Advantage against you until the start of your next turn. Bard Do the benefits from Bardic Inspiration and the Guidance spell stack? Can they be applied to the same roll? Yes, different effects stack if they don’t have the same name. If a creature under the effects of a Guidance spell makes an ability check using the skill chosen as part of the spell’s casting and also has a Bardic Inspiration die, it can roll both 1d4 and 1d6 if it so chooses. If used on a damage roll, does a College of Lore Bard’s Cutting Words apply to any kind of damage roll including an auto-hit spell like Magic Missile? You can use Cutting Words to reduce the damage from any effect that calls for a damage roll (including Magic Missile) even if the damage roll is not preceded by an attack roll. Which Spell Scrolls can Bards understand—spells from the Bard list only, or spells from the Bard list plus spells from Magical Secrets? A Bard can use any Spell Scroll that has a Bard spell on it. This includes any spells the Bard has prepared through their Magical Secrets feature. However, this doesn’t mean that a Bard can use a Spell Scroll for any spell on the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists (the other spell lists included in Magical Secrets). For spells exclusive to the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard lists, a Bard must have that spell prepared via Magical Secrets for it to count as a Bard spell. For example, if a Bard has a Spell Scroll of Spirit Guardians (a spell on the Cleric’s spell list), that Bard can use that scroll only if they also have Spirit Guardians prepared via Magical Secrets. Otherwise, the scroll is illegible to them. For the College of Valor, does using Combat Inspiration’s Offense feature mean that the Bardic Inspiration die counts as a damage die for purposes of Critical Hits? Yes. Druid Can a bound and gagged Druid simply use Wild Shape to get out? It’s hard to capture someone who can turn into a mouse at will. Shape-shifting into a different size can be an effective way of escaping, depending on the nature of the bonds or confinement; for example, Manacles only work on a Small or Medium creature, so shape-shifting into a Tiny animal would allow a Druid to slip out of the restraints with ease. However, a creature changing sizes doesn’t automatically end the Grappled or Restrained conditions unless it causes the creature to no longer meet the effect’s size requirement (if any). For example, a Giant Crab’s Claw attack can grapple only Medium or smaller targets; if a Druid Grappled by a Giant Crab transformed into a Large animal, the Druid would no longer be Grappled. Fighter If my Battle Master Fighter provokes an Opportunity Attack and it misses, can I use Riposte? Yes, you can use the Riposte maneuver in response to an Opportunity Attack that misses you, assuming your Reaction is available. Can the Disarming Attack maneuver cause a creature to drop a Shield? No. Disarming Attack forces a creature to drop an object it is holding. Donned Shields aren’t merely held. Monk Does the Martial Arts feature turn Monk weapons and Unarmed Strikes into Finesse weapons? No. The feature grants a benefit that is similar to the Finesse property, but the feature doesn’t confer that property. Can a Warrior of the Open Hand Monk’s Open Hand Technique push a Large or larger creature or give it the Prone condition? The Open Hand Technique intentionally ignores creature size. A Monk’s energy fuels many extraordinary effects! If a feature is limited by creature size, the feature tells you so. Paladin Would the Divine Sense feature of a Paladin’s Channel Divinity register an Aasimar or a Tiefling due to their heritage? These species are Humanoids and therefore escape the notice of Divine Sense. The feature detects creatures that have the Celestial, Fiend, or Undead creature type. Rogue Can a Rogue use Sneak Attack more than once per round? The Sneak Attack description specifies that you can use the feature once per turn, but it’s not limited to your turn. The feature also doesn’t limit the number of times you can use it in a round. You sometimes get a chance to use Sneak Attack on someone else’s turn. The most common way for this to happen is when an enemy provokes an Opportunity Attack from you. If the requirements for Sneak Attack are met, your Opportunity Attack can benefit from that feature. Does Uncanny Dodge work automatically against every attack a Rogue gets hit by? Spell attacks too? A use of Uncanny Dodge works against only one attack, since it expends your Reaction, and only if you can see the attacker. It works against attacks of all sorts, including spell attacks, but it is no help against a spell or other effect, such as Fireball, that delivers its damage via a saving throw rather than an attack roll. Can a Rogue use Evasion if they are surprised? Yes. Being surprised at the start of a combat causes a creature to have Disadvantage on the Initiative roll. A Rogue can use Evasion as long as they don’t have the Incapacitated condition. Can the Rogue’s Reliable Talent feature be used in conjunction with other features, like the Champion’s Remarkable Athlete feature or the Bard’s Jack of All Trades feature? Reliable Talent can be used in conjunction with another feature as long as the ability check being made meets the requirements for both features. For example, Reliable Talent applies only to a check made using one of your skill or tool proficiencies, while Jack of All Trades applies to a check using a skill proficiency you lack; therefore, a check that qualifies for Reliable Talent doesn’t qualify for Jack of All Trades, and vice versa. However, the Champion’s Remarkable Athlete feature gives Advantage on all Strength (Athletics) check, which doesn’t conflict with Reliable Talent’s requirements. So if a character has proficiency with the Athletics skill and access to both Reliable Talent and Remarkable Athlete, that character could use both features when making a Strength (Athletics) check. Sorcerer Metamagic rules state you can’t use multiple Metamagic options on a single spell. Can you use one option multiple times? A Sorcerer can use one Metamagic option once in the casting of a spell, not the same option more than once. For instance, a Sorcerer can’t quadruple the duration of a spell by spending 2 Sorcery Points on Extended Spell. In Draconic Sorcery, Elemental Affinity improves one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls. So with Scorching Ray, I don’t add my Charisma modifier to each ray that hits? That’s correct. Elemental Affinity benefits one damage roll per casting of a spell, even if the spell allows more than one roll. So, for example, a Sorcerer with Elemental Affinity adds their Charisma modifier to only one of the rays of a Scorching Ray. Can Empowered Spell affect all the rays of a Scorching Ray spell or just one? A Sorcerer’s Empowered Spell could affect more than one ray of a Scorching Ray, abiding by the feature’s die limit. For instance, if you create three rays with the spell and you have a +3 Charisma modifier, you could reroll one of the damage dice for each ray, or two of the damage dice for one ray and one of the damage dice for another one. Does Quickened Spell allow a Sorcerer to cast two spells a round of level 1+? No, the Sorcerer must follow the rule for casting one spell with a spell slot per turn. See chapter 7 in the Player’s Handbook. Can my Sorcerer use Twinned Spell on a spell duplicated by the casting of a Wish spell? Yes, you can as long as the duplicated spell meets the requirements of Twinned Spell. In Wild Magic Sorcery, does the Wild Magic Surge effect replace the effect of the spell that triggered it, or do both effects happen? The spell and the Wild Magic Surge effect both happen. Warlock If a Warlock uses Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, does that weapon have to be a Melee weapon, and can the Warlock change the weapon’s form? The Warlock’s Pact of the Blade feature lets you create a Melee weapon out of nothing. Whenever you do so, you determine the weapon’s form, choosing from the Melee weapon options in the Weapons table in the Player’s Handbook. For example, you can create a Greataxe, and then use the feature again to create a Javelin, which causes the Greataxe to disappear. You can also use Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, turning it into your pact weapon. This magic weapon doesn’t have to be a Melee weapon, so you could use the feature on a +1 Longbow, for instance. However, you can’t change the form of a magic weapon using this feature. For example, if you bond with a Dagger of Venom, you can’t transform it into a Maul; it’s always a Dagger. The feature allows the conjuring forth of a Melee weapon, yet we allow more versatility when it comes to magic weapons. We didn’t want a narrow focus in this feature to make a Warlock unhappy when a variety of magic weapons appear in a campaign. Does this versatility extend outside the melee theme of the feature? It sure does, but we’re willing to occasionally bend a design concept if doing so is likely to increase a player’s happiness. If you’re a Pact of the Blade Warlock, can someone else wield your pact weapon? Yes. Someone other than the Warlock can use a pact weapon—even a conjured pact weapon. However, if the pact weapon is conjured, it disappears if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from the Warlock for 1 minute or more. Does the Awakened Mind feature of a Warlock with a Great Old One Patron allow two-way telepathic communication? Yes. See “Telepathy” in appendix C of the Player’s Handbook. Wizard Is an Abjurer’s Arcane Ward healed only when the ward has 0 Hit Points? The ward regains Hit Points whenever the Abjurer casts an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, not just when the ward has 0 Hit Points. As is normal for healing, the ward can’t regain more Hit Points than its Hit Point maximum: twice the Wizard’s level plus the Wizard’s Intelligence modifier. Does casting Alarm as a Ritual heal Arcane Ward? No. Casting a spell as a Ritual doesn’t use a spell slot, and the Arcane Ward regains Hit Points when the Abjurer casts an Abjuration spell with a spell slot. How does Arcane Ward interact with Temporary Hit Points that an Abjurer might have? When an Abjurer with an Arcane Ward takes damage, it goes through the following steps: - Resistances and Vulnerabilities. If the Wizard has any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, these are applied to the damage total. - Arcane Ward. The ward takes the damage first. - Damage Immunities. Any damage Immunities the Wizard has are applied to leftover damage if the ward is reduced to 0 Hit Points. - Temporary Hit Points. The Wizard takes the leftover damage. If the Wizard has Temporary Hit Points, these are lost first. - Real Hit Points. Any leftover damage after the Temporary Hit Points carries over to the Wizard’s Hit Points. Does the level 14 Illusionist ability let you make something real every round, or just once? Illusory Reality is intended to make one illusory object real per Illusion spell. Can a Diviner on the Ethereal Plane use Portent on a creature that the Wizard can see on the Material Plane? Yes. Portent requires you to see the creature, but it has no range restriction. For a Wizard to cast a Ritual spell contained in their spellbook, do they need to read from the book or use it as part of the Ritual? Thanks to the Ritual Adept feature, a Wizard can cast spells with the Ritual tag in their spellbook as a Ritual without preparing the spell, in addition to following the normal rules of Ritual spells. If a Wizard is casting a spell that they don’t have prepared as a Ritual, then the Wizard must read from the spellbook, as the text of Ritual Adept states. However, if a Wizard is casting a spell they have prepared as a Ritual following the normal rules, they don’t need to consult their spellbook (unless they’re using it as a Spellcasting Focus for said spell). Backgrounds Can you have more than one background? No. You can have only one background. It establishes key aspects of your life before you embarked on a life of adventure. Species Traits Does the Halfling’s Naturally Stealthy trait allow them to hide while observed? Normally, to take the Hide action, you must meet the following criteria: - You must be Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters or Total Cover. - You must be out of any enemy’s line of sight. The Halfling’s Naturally Stealthy trait allows you to bypass these criteria if you’re obscured by a creature at least one size larger than you. However, you still must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check as you normally would when taking the Hide action, so there’s no guarantee of success. Feats Archery Does the Archery feat work with a Melee weapon that you throw? No, the Archery feat benefits only attack rolls you make with Ranged weapons. The Thrown Weapon Fighting feat benefits ranged attack rolls made with Melee weapons with the Thrown property. Charger If you have the Charger feat, can you use the Charge Attack benefit while mounted? Yes, but only on a controlled mount. When a mount moves, you move with it. Therefore, if the mount moves 10 feet in a straight line toward a target, you also move 10 feet in a straight line toward a target. However, you still must immediately take the Attack action after this movement to gain the benefit of Charge Attack. This is feasible on a controlled mount, since a controlled mount moves on your turn. Conversely, you can’t use Charge Attack if you’re riding an independent mount, since an independent mount moves on a separate turn, and you’re not able to immediately take the Attack action after that movement. Crossbow Expert Does Crossbow Expert let you fire a Hand Crossbow and then fire it again as a Bonus Action? The Crossbow Expert feat allows you to fire a Hand Crossbow multiple times on your turn. But you still must abide by the rules of the Hand Crossbow’s Light property, which state that the property’s additional attack must be made with a different weapon. Dual Wielder Can my character wield two Heavy weapons if they have the Dual Wielder feat? The Dual Wielder feat allows you to simultaneously draw two weapons that lack the Two-Handed property. All Heavy weapons in the Player’s Handbook have the Two-Handed property, so they don’t benefit from this feat. (However, if we were to create a Heavy weapon that lacks the Two-Handed property in the future, that weapon could be used with this feat!) Dueling Is the Dueling feat intended to support using a Shield? Yes. A character with the Dueling feat can equip a Shield or hold a Spellcasting Focus or another object that isn’t a weapon in their other hand. Great Weapon Fighting If you use Great Weapon Fighting with a spell like Divine Smite or Hex, do you get to treat any 1 or 2 you roll for the additional damage as a 3? The Great Weapon Fighting feat benefits only the damage roll of the weapon used for the attack. For example, if you have this feat and make an attack roll with a Greatsword, you can treat any 1 or 2 you roll on the weapon’s 2d6 as a 3. If you cast Divine Smite after hitting with this attack, you can’t treat a 1 or 2 rolled for the spell’s damage as a 3. Magic Initiate If you’re a spellcaster, can you pick your own class when you gain the Magic Initiate feat? Yes. For example, if you’re a Wizard and gain the Magic Initiate feat, you can choose Wizard for the feat. Polearm Master Can I add my Strength modifier to the damage of the bonus attack that Polearm Master gives me? Yes. For the feat’s bonus attack, you add your ability modifier to the attack roll, as you do whenever you attack with that weapon, and if you hit, you add the same ability modifier to the damage roll, which is normal for weapon damage rolls. A specific rule, such as the Light property, might break the general rule by telling you not to add your ability modifier to the damage. Polearm Master doesn’t have such a rule. Savage Attacker Does the benefit of the Savage Attacker feat apply to additional effects like the Rogue’s Sneak Attack or the Paladin’s Divine Smite? No. The benefit of Savage Attacker applies only to rolls of the weapon’s damage dice, not to any extra damage that a feature or other ability might grant. Equipment Does Heavy armor reduce Dexterity saving throws or ability checks other than Stealth? If you have training with it, Heavy armor doesn’t affect Dexterity saving throws or ability checks, other than Stealth. If you attack with a Shield—most likely as an improvised weapon—do you keep the +2 bonus to AC? Attacking with a Shield doesn’t deprive you of the Shield’s bonus to AC. Spellcasting General Which of a character’s spells count as class spells? For example, if I’m playing a Sorcerer, which of my character’s spells are Sorcerer spells? A class’s spell list specifies the spells that belong to the class. For example, a Sorcerer spell is a spell on the Sorcerer spell list, and if a Sorcerer knows spells that aren’t on that list, those spells aren’t Sorcerer spells unless a feature says otherwise. Can a spellcaster cast spells off-target to minimize damage to party members from a spell like Shatter? The spellcaster chooses where to place the point of origin of a spell like Shatter and may, therefore, choose a position that is advantageous to allies. Can permanent magical effects be dispelled? Or are they no longer considered magical effects once permanent? If the effect of a spell becomes permanent, it can be dispelled unless its description says otherwise (such as in the Wall of Stone spell). Do spellcasters have to learn a Ritual version of a spell apart from the normal version, or are they the same? If a spell has the Ritual tag and you have it prepared, you can cast it as a Ritual. You don’t need to prepare it twice or learn a different version. Can spellcasters prepare spells not all at once, but at various times throughout the adventure? No. Your spellcasting feature specifies exactly when you can change your list of prepared spells and the number of spells you can change. For example, if you’re a Cleric, you change your list of prepared spells when you finish a Long Rest. You can’t prepare some spells at the end of the rest and then prepare more later. Spell Attacks Is a touch range spell considered a melee attack for purposes of subduing foes rather than killing? Having a range of touch doesn’t mean a spell is a melee attack. A spell tells you if it delivers such an attack. Can spell attacks score Critical Hits? A spell attack can score a Critical Hit. The rule on Critical Hits applies to attack rolls of any sort. When casting a spell that affects multiple targets, such as Scorching Ray or Eldritch Blast, do I fire one ray or beam, determine the result, and fire again? Or do I have to choose all the targets before making any attack rolls? Even though the duration of each of these spells is instantaneous, you choose the targets and resolve the attacks consecutively, not all at once. If you want, you can declare all your targets before making any attacks, but you would still roll separately for each attack roll (and damage, if appropriate). Can a spell with an attack roll be used as the attack in the Attack action or as part of the Extra Attack feature? No. As explained in the Player’s Handbook, you can take one action on your turn in combat, in addition to moving. You choose your action from the options available to everyone—options such as Attack, Dash, and Magic—or you choose from among the special actions you’ve gained from a class or another source. To cast a spell on your turn, you take the Magic action. Doing so means you’re not taking the Attack action or any other action. It is true that a number of spells, such as Fire Bolt and Ray of Frost, involve making an attack roll, but you can’t make such an attack without first casting the spell that delivers it. In other words, just because something involves an attack roll doesn’t mean the Attack action is being used. By extension, the Extra Attack feature (given by several classes, including the Fighter and Paladin) doesn’t let you cast extra attack spells. That feature specifically relies on the Attack action, not the Magic action or any other action. In summary, to make a spell attack, you have to first cast a spell or use a feature that creates the spell’s effect. A game feature, such as Extra Attack, that lets you make an attack doesn’t let you cast a spell unless it says it does. Can you use a melee spell attack to make an Opportunity Attack? No, you can’t cast a spell when a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you. This is because each spell has a casting time. For example, the Chill Touch spell has a casting time of an action. A game mechanic, such as Opportunity Attack, doesn’t let you alter that casting time unless a feature says otherwise (see the War Caster feat for an example of this). Some spells (like Guiding Bolt) target a creature. Some others (like Fire Bolt) target objects too. Does this mean that I can’t attack the door with Guiding Bolt? The target specifications (creature, object, or something else) in spells are intentional. Spell Level What level is a spell if you cast it without a spell slot? Unless the text says otherwise, a spell cast without a spell slot is cast at its lowest possible level, which is the level that appears in its description. An example of an exception to this is often found in monster stat blocks. A monster with the Spellcasting action may have spells listed with a “(level # version)” parenthetical. This means the spell is still cast without a spell slot, but its effects are equival"
