  "text": "Is the Home Depot appliance protection plan any good? Anyone have experience with it? Looking at buying a new washer and dryer, and curious what my best option is for a protection plan. Is Home Depot's any good? Other suggestions for good service assistance beyond the initial manufacturer warranty? (If all you have to say is \"don't buy a warranty,\" then I'm not interested in your opinion. I'd like to know whether this specific warranty will provide value if it's needed.)"
