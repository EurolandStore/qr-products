  "text": "I have a SharePoint site with several lists each having their own set of permissions. Rather than manage reporting on the users who have permission, and changes to permissions manually in SharePoint, I would rather automate the process with Power Automate flows. There are several steps/actions in Power Automate that I have been attempting to use: Send an HTTP request to SharePoint This seems to be the most general approach, but I have not found a resource that lists the URI values that I need to provide to get (to collect a list of users) or post (to make changes). Grant access to an item or a folder and Stop sharing an item or a file While these do not help with getting a list of the users, it seems that I could collect all the items in a list and use this action to update the separate permissions of each item. Unless, there is an ID value that represents the entire list? If there is more information that would be helpful in providing an answer, please let me know."
