  "text": "Kinder Chocolate Kinder (Italian: Kinder Cioccolato) is a brand of chocolate bar produced by Italian multinational confectionery company Ferrero SpA. History [edit]In Alba, Italy, in 1968, Michele Ferrero,[2] proposed to market a product that was palatable to children (with chocolate) and at the same time reassuring to mothers (with milk), thus the slogan \"+ milk (latte) – cocoa (cacao)\" shown on the package. In 1968, Kinder Chocolate, a milk chocolate with a milky filling, was introduced to the German and Italian markets. The word \"Kinder\", used as a universal brand, is German for \"children\". The product gained commercial success, and was later sold in other European countries.[3] The face of a child is depicted (first by Günter Euringer, then by Matteo Farneti) on the right side of Kinder Chocolate bar packages to suggest to buyers the idea of a product for children.[4][5][6] References [edit]- ^ United States Food and Drug Administration (2024). \"Daily Value on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\".
