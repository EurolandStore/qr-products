  "text": "It's actually a serious question. Between waking up at 6:15-6:30 AM, getting home around 6:00-6:30 PM, and having dinner by 7:00 PM at the earliest, I have zero energy for any hobby or anything afterwards until it's bed time. Partially I blame the winter and cold weather. Edit: M30. Like I want to search for the next dentist place or my first vacation or a book to read or find an activity for the weekend but I feel so exhausted with zero energy or motivation... until I'm back in the office the next morning and feel guilty for yet another unproductive personal life."
