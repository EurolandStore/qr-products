  "title": "punctuation - Which is correct Dr. or Dr? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange",
  "text": "The Oxford Learners' Dictionary says: Mr abbreviation (British English) (also Mr. North American English, British English) While the Oxford Learner's Dictionary of American English just states: Mr. abbreviation and has no entry for Mr without the period. So I believe that both Mr and Mr. are acceptable in British English (even though Mr without period is preferred), while Mr. with period is mandatory in American English. As an Italian, I prefer Mr without the period, because in school we were taught that the period following an abbreviation stood for \"following letters omitted\", but the r in Mr and in Dr is the last letter of Mister and Doctor, so no letter following \"r\" is omitted. I think that the British usage tends to conform to this \"European\" (Latin?) rule."
