  "text": "Each of our wine styles represents a unique and special aspect of the Alsace region. Our Reserve wines showcase the different grape varieties, our Cuvée Émile Willm expresses the relationship between the terroir and the grapes themselves, and our Grands Crus Kirchberg de Barr and the Clos Gaensbrœnnel wine types are a pure expression of terroir."
