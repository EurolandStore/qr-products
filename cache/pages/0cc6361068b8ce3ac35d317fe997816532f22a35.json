First navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, https://github.com. In the upper-right corner click on the Sign Up button, as outlined in this screenshot: Create Your Account You’ll see a page with a form under the heading “Create your account”. Fill in each field for username, email address, and password. Choosing a username and email are especially important! Be sure to read through the following tips. Username When choosing a username, it’s wise to choose one you wouldn’t mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name like firstnamelastname or using initials, like i_lastname , are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make pull requests or reviews. Remember, you’re likely using this account to share or access code. Also be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end. Email Address Like with usernames, pick an email that you’re comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it’s important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default. Finish Creating Your Account Lastly, fill out the password field. When you’re done filling out the various fields, verify your account. You will receive an email from GitHub prompting you to verify. Once you see a green checkmark, click on the blue Create an Account button. Go to your email account, find the email from GitHub, and click on the button inside it to finish creating your account. Settings After successfully creating an account, you should see a page display asking you “What do you want to do first?” Go through the steps to complete your own set up process. You should now see a welcome page: You can either answer the optional questions or move on by clicking on the Complete setup button to finish creating your account.
