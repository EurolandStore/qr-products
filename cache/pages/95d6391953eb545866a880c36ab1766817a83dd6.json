  "text": "Charity Navigator's ratings previously did not consider Leadership & Adaptability, Culture & Community, or Impact & Measurement. The historic rating mainly reflects a version of today’s Accountability and Finance score. More information on our previous rating methodologies can be found on our rating methodology page. This beacon provides an assessment of a charity's financial health (financial efficiency, sustainability, and trustworthiness) and its commitment to governance practices and policies. Majority Independent Board Members - 94% independent members 10 out of 10 points Industry professionals strongly recommend an independent governing body to allow for full deliberation and diversity of thinking on governance and other organizational matters. We check to see that a majority of board members are identified as independent on their tax form. Source: IRS Form 990 Independent Board Size - 17 independent members 10 out of 10 points Industry professionals strongly recommend an independent governing body to allow for full deliberation and diversity of thinking on governance and other organizational matters. For most organizations, we check to see if the organization has at least three independent board members. For large, donor-funded organizations, we check to see if the organization has at least five independent board members Source: IRS Form 990 Financial Statements - Audit and Oversight Committee 20 out of 20 points An Audit, Review, or Compilation provides important information about financial accountability and accuracy. Organizations are scored based on their Total Revenue Amount: Source: IRS Form 990 Material Diversion of Assets - None 20 out of 20 points A diversion of assets — any unauthorized conversion or use of the organization's assets other than for the organization's authorized purposes, including but not limited to embezzlement or theft — also can seriously call into question a charity's financial integrity. We review the charity's most recent IRS Form 990 to see if the charity has reported any diversion of assets. Source: IRS Form 990 Tax Form Disclosures and Policies Full Credit Partial Credit No Credit Website Listed on Tax Form - Listed 5 out of 5 points Charity Navigator looks for a website on the IRS Form 990 as an accountability and transparency metric. Nonprofits act in the public trust and reporting publicly on activities is an important component. Source: IRS Form 990 Conflict of Interest Policy - Listed 5 out of 5 points Charity Navigator looks for the existence of a conflict of interest policy on the IRS Form 990 as an accountability and transparency measure. This policy protects the organization and by extension those it serves, when it is considering entering into a transaction that may benefit the private interest of an officer, director and/or key employee of the organization. Source: IRS Form 990 Whistleblower Policy - Listed 5 out of 5 points Charity Navigator looks for the existence of a whistleblower policy per the IRS Form 990 as an accountability and transparency measure. This policy outlines procedures for handling employee complaints, as well as a confidential way for employees to report financial or other types of mismanagement. Source: IRS Form 990 Document Retention and Destruction - Listed 5 out of 5 points Charity Navigator looks for the existence of a document retention and destruction policy per the IRS Form 990 as an accountability and transparency measure. This policy establishes guidelines for the handling, backing up, archiving and destruction of documents. These guidelines foster good record keeping procedures that promote data integrity. Source: IRS Form 990 Documents Board Meeting Minutes - Yes 5 out of 5 points Charity Navigator looks to confirm on the IRS Form 990 that the organization has this process in place as an accountability and transparency measure. An official record of the events that take place during a board meeting ensures that a contemporaneous document exists for future reference. Source: IRS Form 990 Tax Form Distributed to Board Before Filing - Missing 0 out of 5 points Providing copies of the IRS Form 990 to the governing body prior to filing is considered a best practice, as it allows for thorough review by the individuals charged with overseeing the organization. The Form 990 asks the charity to disclose whether or not it has followed this best practice. Loans to/from Officers - None 5 out of 5 points Making loans to related parties, such as key officers, staff, or Board members, is not standard practice in the sector as it diverts the charity's funds away from its charitable mission and can lead to real and perceived conflict-of-interest problems. The IRS requires charities to disclose on their Form 990 any loans to or from current and former officers, directors, trustees, key employees, and other \"disqualified persons.\" Some state laws go so far as to prohibit loans to board members and officers. Although employees and trustees are permitted to make loans to charities, this practice can also result in real and/or perceived conflict of interest problems for the charity. Furthermore, it is problematic because it indicates that the organization is not financially secure. Our analysts check to see if any loans have been made. Website Disclosures Full Credit Partial Credit No Credit Form 990 indicates tax form is available on nonprofit's website - Yes 5 out of 5 points For almost all charities, we check the charity's IRS Form 990 to see if it discloses that the Form 990 is available on the charity's website. As with the audited financial statement, donors need easy access to this financial report to help determine if the organization is managing its financial resources well.

This ratio is an indicator of an organization's solvency and/or long-term sustainability. Source: IRS Form 990 Program Expense Ratio: 73.95% 25 out of 25 points The Program Expense Ratio is determined by Program Expenses divided by Total Expense (average of most recent three IRS Forms 990). This measure reflects the percent of its total expenses a charity spends on the programs and services it exists to deliver.
