  "text": "Context and the actual sentence make a difference. In your sentence, \"more preferred\" is unnecessary and even wrong, but as I said, it could work in other sentences. \"More preferred\" suggests that out of multiple preferred things, there's a stronger preference for one.but sometimes I read sentences with \"more preferred\" and I was confused. Based on that, in written language, I think \"more preferred\" should be avoided."
