A few light design updates to how galleries and sub-galleries display on your Profile make it easier for you and your fans to navigate and explore your work. What’s new: The updated layout puts more focus on your art by reducing empty space and making navigation more intuitive. Galleries and sub-galleries together. Sub-galleries now appear in the same carousel as regular galleries. When you open a gallery, its sub-galleries appear alongside it, with a back button to the parent gallery. This brings your art higher on the page, so viewers can easily discover and enjoy it! Cleaner gallery thumbnails. Thumbnails now put more emphasis on your images (your art!), with less wasted space and slightly tighter margins and padding. (Before vs. after) Check out your updated Gallery tab on Profile and share your thoughts in the comments below! Note: This update is rolling out gradually, so you might not see it yet."
