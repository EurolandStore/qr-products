Many appreciate the action choreography and cinematography, while others condemn it for gratuitous brutality and lack of meaningful narrative. The film's controversial depiction of violence, especially against vulnerable groups, sparks significant societal concern, leading to mixed reception. Featured reviews The movie's action sequences were truly exceptional, standing out as the film's strongest aspect. Each scene was crafted with precision and delivered high-intensity moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. The climax was another highlight, uniquely designed and breaking away from conventional Bollywood tropes, which added a refreshing twist to the narrative. However, the movie fell short when it came to the emotional depth of the story. There was a noticeable lack of connection with the characters, and the storyline felt underdeveloped, making it hard to fully invest in the plot. While the action and climax were impressive, the weak storytelling left the overall experience feeling incomplete. Despite its flaws, the movie is worth watching for its action and unique climax. I'd rate it a 7/10 for its efforts in pushing boundaries, even if the story didn't fully deliver. However, the movie fell short when it came to the emotional depth of the story.

Don't be mistaken I have watched \"I Saw The Devil\" & \"Old Boy\" they are violent cuz the story demands it. In this case is dumb, stupid and plain nonsensical. Absolute garbage of a movie. Very disappointed to see such a movie from Malayalam industry where generally most of the movies are amazing in story and acting. No story at all. Unnecessary bg and slomo, over hyped. Pointless killings gore. Absolute torture of 2 hours and 24 mins. 1st half you still feel okay it's leading some where. But the 2nd half wow During the entire time I was scratching my head thinking just when will this end. In this case is dumb, stupid and plain nonsensical. Absolute garbage of a movie.

But the 2nd half wow During the entire time I was scratching my head thinking just when will this end. First of all , the story is straight up mediocre and a common story from old movie . It's the fight scenes and last 30 minutes that made the movie lit.. The cinematography, Camera , editing , and especially music is top notch.. People were claiming it to be violent from beginning to end and i bet they haven't watched Hollywood, Indonesian french movies like inside , Night comes for us etc ... There is a lot of space for improvement in case of fight as most fight was using hand..i was expecting something like raid , but was just normal fight scene with some violence here and there .. Huge let down is from cgi team.. when a person is attacked using knife , blood is shown splattering which is clearly cgi and we can see it.. could've used real blood or atleast a better cgi.. Could ve used the chainsaw scenes better.. Felt like wasted opportunity. The stair case fight was technically and stylistically great , but action wise not good.hits people with something and shows fake cgi blood. And most scenes are done in dark to cover up bad cgi . Some dialogues were cringe, and unnecessary.. some dialogues were fire.. It's actually a mixed bag saved by the intensely disturbing last 30 minutes. I don't think people would sit and watch the portion before the last 30 minutes when it's released on Netflix. When it says intermission, i was like.. what.. nothing happened so far.. that's how bad the story is.. could've been better . But i wouldn't mind if from the beginning till end the movie was the same as the last 30 minutes.. Casting were all good.. unni did great.. Could've used more props in fight scenes than using bare hands.. Could've used prosthetic body and fake blood to show cutting and stabbing than using cgi . Anyway recommend watching for the last 30 minutes.

The plot of the story revolves around the gold syndicate and how the business rivalry among the cartel develops to a personal rivalry whereby the title character Marco retaliates forms the base for the storyline. Haneef Adeni's idea of developing a standalone movie of a savage character from his filmography deserves appreciation. He has given umpteen action moments in the movie for the title character but falls flat in developing a strong screenplay which is evident through few cliche sequences in the first half. The latter half is an absolute banger with swagging action sequences, violence and bloodshed. Unni Mukundan has given an outstanding performance as Marco the monster through hardcore action sequences and violence and proves he is an absolute showstopper delivering one of his best performance. Jagadish has given a splendid delivery of the character but gives an impression that the potential of a versatile actor was unutilised showing minor flaws of the character arc. Impressive performances by Siddique,Kabir Duhan Singh,Anson Paul & Abhimanyu S Thilakan,giving ample avenue for performance through his debut movie. Brilliant capture by Chandru Selvaraj bolstered with Ravi Basrur's lightning BGM's. Shameer Muhammed has precisely trimmed the movie to an action entertainer. Special mention to Kalai Kingson for the dashing actions and the colorist Srik Varier for the brilliant color toning. Hats off to Shareef Muhammed for being the frontrunner in delivering a hardcore violence movie in Malayalam. Please don't leave the theatres before the end credits. A must watch movie on big screens to witness the technical brilliance and extreme action violence sequences. Period. A one of a kind action violence drama movie unprecedented in Malayalam.

A must watch movie on big screens to witness the technical brilliance and extreme action violence sequences. Period. Watched the movie in the theater on the first day and have to say, had mixed feelings. The action scenes, bgm and some of the acting are top notch in Marco. It was also interesting to see mollywood upping the boundaries to unseen levels in some of the action sequences. However, what let's Marco down, big time, is the lack of a good story and hilarious lines in serious situations. There is no logic of rationale to Marco's aggression cos the killing of his brother and their relationship etc. Is not well established. Jagadeesh's character is quite interesting, but who asks fora threesome when he is about to get killed? Unni's dialogue delivery falls flat in certain areas as well. And of course the last action sequences, where Unni gets beaten back and blue and then gets up takes a shower and kills everyone. I mean, really? I hope we malayalees can hold films to a better standard than hailing this movie, cos to be honest, it's a very weak attempt overall. Hope this inspires future movie makers to adopt such visceral action, but with a good story. Did you know - TriviaAs much as 300 liter of fake blood was used in the making of the film. It was made using a chemical and lots of sugar, leading Unni Mukundan to joke that diabetic people should not be a part of a film with such bloodshed due to the blood's \"sweetness.\" - GoofsAll entries contain spoilers - Alternate versionsThe film received an \"A\" certificate from the CBFC after cuts were made for some scenes depicting excessive violence against women and children and warning cards were inserted. - ConnectionsSpin-off from Mikhael (2019) - SoundtracksBlood Vocals by Dabzee, Rohith Siddappa, Santhosh Venky Details - Release date - Country of origin - Languages - Also known as - Марко - Filming locations - Munnar, Kerala, India(first schedule) - Production company - See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office - Budget - ₹320,000,000 (estimated) - Gross worldwide - $1,983,898 - Runtime - 2h 25m(145 min) - Color - Sound mix - Aspect ratio - 2.35 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content"
