  "text": "Error 8 (e-8) and lots of white smoke Hello team. All suggestions welcomed. Installed our CDH last week, had a few problems with pins being bent in the harness but got it working just fine. We’ve had it running one or two nights perfectly then come to start it up again the other night and it’s not working properly. We turn it on, the fan starts, the pump starts ticking away, I watch the fuel being moved towards the heating unit then loads of white smoke from the exhaust. Eventually it tries pumping more fuel (faster ticking from pump) then cuts off showing an e8 error whilst still pumping loads of white smoke out. Seems like the glow plug isn’t lighting up? Things I’ve tried: - checking fuel line, all seems attached fine but there is constantly some air in the section after the pump before the unit. - checking power, voltage is good - checking air intake, going to do take this properly off today and make sure there no shit in there Suggestions/Videos greatly appreciated! It’s cold in Canada! Thanks in advance x Edit: Forgot model of CDH. It’s a Vevor 5kw (grey body with newer lcd screen)"
