When it comes to sweetening our food and drinks, sugar is a popular choice. But have you heard of Nabat? Nabat, also known as Persian sugar, is a type of sugar that is commonly used in Middle Eastern and South Asian cuisine. In this post, we will explore the differences between regular sugar and Nabat, and take a closer look at the various types of sugar available on Sadaf.com. What is Nabat? Nabat is a type of sugar that is traditionally made from crystallizing sugar water. The resulting sugar crystals are then formed into small, cube-shaped pieces. Nabat has a unique taste and texture, with a slightly crunchy exterior and a sweet, melt-in-your-mouth interior. What are the Differences Between Regular Sugar and Nabat? One of the biggest differences between regular sugar and Nabat is the way they are processed. While regular sugar is typically refined and stripped of its natural molasses, Nabat is made by slowly evaporating sugar water until the sugar crystals form. This process helps to retain the natural flavors and nutrients of the sugar. Nabat is also known for its unique texture. The cube-shaped pieces of sugar have a crunchy exterior that gives way to a soft, sweet interior. This makes Nabat a popular choice for adding sweetness and texture to tea and other hot beverages.
