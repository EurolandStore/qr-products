In a nutshell 3 is a prime number. Like all primes (except two), it is an odd number and has no factors apart from itself and one. Prime factorization of 3: 3 What makes 3 an interesting number from a mathematical point of view? Like all numbers, it has a distinctive mathematical structure. Its factors, divisors, and base properties can show some interesting behavior. This page gives an overview of what makes this integer stand out. Below you’ll find its key properties, along with some statistical info, fun facts and trivia. Notation 3 can be expressed in many ways apart from the usual decimal (base-10) notation. It can be written out in words, with formatting and even extra punctuation added depending on the language. In more technical situations, numbers are commmonly expressed in scientific notation or in different base systems such as binary or hex. - Written form in US english: ‘Three’ - Written form in British english: ‘Three’ - Scientific notation: 3 × 100 - Binary (base-2): 112 - Octal (base-8): 38 - Hexadecimal (base-16): 0x3 - Base-36: 3 Prime factorization of 3 Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to form that number. You could say that a number is made or ‘composed’ of its prime factors. Every whole number greater than one is formed from at least one prime factor. (Prime numbers have only one prime factor: themselves.) Calculating the prime factors of a number is known as prime factorization. For very large numbers this can be a challenging task. How many prime factors does 3 have? As a prime number, it can only have one factor: itself. Divisors of 3 Divisors are the numbers that divide a given number exactly, with no remainder. How many divisors does 3 have? As a prime number, it can only have two divisors: itself and one. - Number of divisors d(n): 2 - Number of proper divisors τ(n)−1: 1 - List of divisors. Here is the complete set: - Sum of all divisors σ(n): 4 - Sum of proper divisors (its aliquot sum) s(n): 1 - Like all prime numbers, 3 is a ‘deficient’ (or ‘defective’) number, because the sum of its proper divisors (1) is less than itself. Its deficiency is 2 Roots and squares of 3 Roots of a number are numbers that, when multiplied by themselves a certain number of times, give the original number. For example, the square root of four is two, because 2 × 2 = 4. Squares are numbers obtained by multiplying a number by itself a certain number of times. Scales and comparisons How big is 3? The following comparisons will give you some idea. - A solid cube with a volume of 3 cubic inches would be around 1.44 inches high. Fun! Recreational maths with 3 - 3 is the same when its digits are reversed. That makes it a palindromic prime number ! - 3 is a twin prime ! It is only two numbers away from another prime – the closest possible prime gap. Twin primes become increasingly rare as numbers grow larger, but if the twin prime conjecture is true, there are infinitely many. Its twin is 5 - It has 1 decimal digits. - If you add the digits together you get 3 - 3 is exactly divisible by the sum of its digits (3) in base 10. That means 3 is a Harshad number (aka Niven number) . - More fun facts coming soon. About this page Data compiled by the Numbermatics team. Page content last reviewed: 18 January 2026.
