  "text": "Where does the expression \"ta\" come from? Wikipedia has only this to say: \"ta!\", slang, Exclam. Thank you! {Informal}, an expression of gratitude but no additional information or links about its genesis. I have only ever heard it from englishmen and -women. Is it used anywhere else in the world? How did it come about? What is its history?"
