  "text": "Salami is defined by the quality of the meat, spices, and most importantly, time. Our master salumiere Lorenzo says that like wine, everyone has their own ideas about what the perfect flavor profile is. That’s why we practice time-honored techniques to create the traditional, beloved salame of centuries gone by. The temperature and humidity of the room where salame dries are two of the most defining factors in its creation. Many years ago, windows were simply opened or closed at various points in the day. Today, we mimic those traditional practices with informed precision."
