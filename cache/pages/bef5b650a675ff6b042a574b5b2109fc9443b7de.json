  "text": "Smile... is it awful, or is that just me? I (finally) watched Smile, and y\"all, I hated it. I don't know if the hype got to me, but I just couldn't get into this movie. Horror movies being created as metaphors is a good thing, and there have been some i enjoyed. But I couldn't connect with this movie. The only scene that could have been a good scare was ruined in the preview (car+sister). The rest was just blah. The premise was good and I think it could have been a great movie it just fell flat on its face. The best part was the MC's acting. She is good. I don't know if I'm just desensitized or too picky in my older age, but Smile was not it. What were your opinions of it? Am I crazy for disliking it so wholly? I need a good, SCARY pallette cleanser after this one! Going to start season 2 of From and keep my fingers crossed its still good"
