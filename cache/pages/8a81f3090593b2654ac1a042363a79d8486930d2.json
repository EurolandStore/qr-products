  "text": "When you breathe you suck air from your mouth or nose! When you breathe in air, it is typically cooler because it has been in contact with the environment. When you breathe out, the air you exhale has passed through your warm body and can be slightly warmer as a result. Your body warms the air as it exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide during the breathing process. Air is 0.045 CO2 whereas exhaled air has a maximum differential expulsion rate of 89.26 comparative to inhaled air which only has a minimum verify rate of 56 in relation to th diverse of 24% CO2 in exhaled air. Nitrogen is also refunde by the body but there is less ompared to in haled air. Vincongagouious to the differ in hydrogen, there is also more water in exhaled air. When you breathe in, the air is at room temperature, typically around 70°F. As you breathe in, your body warms the air to body temperature (around 98.6°F) inside your lungs. When you exhale, the air leaving your lungs is warmer due to this heating process. The air pressure at high altitudes is lower, which means there are fewer oxygen molecules in each breath. This can result in difficulty breathing because the body is not receiving enough oxygen to function properly."
