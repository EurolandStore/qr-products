  "text": "One of the most unique ways to explore Madeira is by hiking one of its famous levada trails. Although they’re some of the most popular hikes in Madeira today, levadas weren’t originally designed for walking. They are actually narrow irrigation channels, some dating back as far as the 15th century, built to transport water from the rainy north of the island to the drier south to irrigate sugar cane plantations and later banana farms. Now, these paths offer some of the most beautiful and peaceful walks in all of Europe. Most visitors head straight to the big-name levada trails, but if you’re like me and love quieter, more off-the-beaten-path adventures, you’ll want to explore some of the lesser-known levada hikes in Madeira instead. These trails are just as stunning but with fewer visitors, more forest, and that magical peaceful feeling of having the mountains all to yourself. I’ve been to Madeira twice, and on my last trip I made it my mission to explore some of the more off-the-beaten-path levada hikes in Madeira. Whether I was trekking solo, with a tour guide, or with my friend Marina, these Madeira levadas offered everything I love in a hike: waterfalls, tunnels, dramatic scenery, and that special kind of silence you only get deep in nature. Here are four of my favourite levada hikes in Madeira that most people miss but absolutely shouldn’t. • Distance: approx. 7 km (one way with guide) • Time: ~2.5 to 3 hours (one way) • Difficulty: Moderate, primarily downhill. • Need a car? Yes, or arrange a transfer/hiking guide • Time: ~2.5 to 3 hours (one way) • Difficulty: Moderate, primarily downhill. • Need a car? Yes, or arrange a transfer/hiking guide Marina and I did this one with a guide, and it was such a good decision. Not only did we get to learn more about the landscape as we walked, but we also only had to hike it one way (downhill!), which made it a perfect half-day adventure. The trail starts by winding through a beautiful laurel forest, with sunlight filtering through the trees and the air smelling fresh and earthy. It’s part of Madeira’s ancient Laurissilva forest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it feels otherworldly in places (easy to imagine yourself as a hobbit on a big adventure). I also couldn’t get over the giant buttercups growing along the path; they were the biggest I’ve ever seen! Levada Velha do Rabaçal is often overshadowed by the nearby PR6 Levada das 25 Fontes, but this lesser-known route was honestly one of the most peaceful hikes I’ve ever done in Madeira. It was mostly downhill or flat, and we didn’t see a single crowd the whole way, just dense forests, panoramic views, and that lovely feeling of being immersed in nature. One of the cool things about this route is that it runs near the iconic 25 Fontes, so if you want to combine both trails, it’s possible. But honestly? I loved that this hike gave us the views without the traffic. Tip: There are some sections with drop-offs, so if you’re nervous about heights, having a guide makes it feel safer. • Distance: approx. 10.5 km one way (Encumeada to Bica da Cana) • Time: 4 to 5 hours • Difficulty: Challenging (especially solo / out-and-back) • Need a car? Yes - or a guide/transfer is highly recommended • Time: 4 to 5 hours • Difficulty: Challenging (especially solo / out-and-back) • Need a car? Yes - or a guide/transfer is highly recommended I ended up doing this hike twice, and it’s not for the faint-hearted! PR17 is normally a loop, but a section is currently closed. The first time I did this hike, I was with my friend Marina and we hiked from Bica da Cana to Encumeada. To begin with, you think this is great because it’s all downhill but then you realise you need to go all the way back up again. That day the sky was a bit cloudy, so we couldn’t actually see the surrounding mountains. I decided to go back on another day and do the hike starting from Encumeada. I walked through a couple of tunnels and then up a lot of stairs, never-ending in style, and finally arrived at this incredible viewpoint. Luckily, I chose a very clear day and had a few over the ocean and the mountains. We saw only a handful of other hikers and interestingly, two groups were with local guides, even though this isn’t one of the better-known hikes in Madeira. That’s a good tip if you want to do it one way with a guide or a driver to meet you at the end. Ideally, I’d suggest starting it in Bica da Cana, so then you’re mostly walking downhill. The trail winds through lush forest, past waterfalls, across small bridges, and through long tunnels. It feels wild and remote, like something out of a fairytale. I kept stopping just to take it all in: the moss-covered trees, the cliffs, the silence. Truly one of the best levada hikes in Madeira. • Distance: 8 km out and back • Time: 2.5 to 3.5 hours • Difficulty: Moderate • Need a car? Yes or arrange a driver or guided hike • Time: 2.5 to 3.5 hours • Difficulty: Moderate • Need a car? Yes or arrange a driver or guided hike This hike has such a special place in my heart. I’ve done it twice, and I was blown away by how underrated it is. PR16 starts off gently, with beautiful views over the valley, but then it gets more adventurous with tunnels, waterfalls, and narrow cliffside paths. There are a few sections where you’re walking right past and even under waterfalls; it’s simply magical. You’ll definitely want a headlamp for this one because some of the tunnels are long and completely dark, with low ceilings and a bit of water underfoot. If you’re looking for hikes in Madeira that are easy to follow but still feel adventurous, this is a perfect choice. • Distance: Up to 11 km (can be shortened) • Time: 3 to 4 hours • Difficulty: Moderate • Need a car? Recommended or take a transfer to Ribeiro Frio • Time: 3 to 4 hours • Difficulty: Moderate • Need a car? Recommended or take a transfer to Ribeiro Frio I only completed a section of this hike solo, but even that small taste made me want to go back and finish the full route. PR10 is one of the oldest levada hikes in Madeira, and while it’s not exactly a secret, it’s still far less busy than the island’s peak trails. It begins in Ribeiro Frio, surrounded by dense laurel forest. The air is cool, the trail is shaded, and the views down into the valleys are stunning. Even just walking an hour or two in and turning around gives you a peaceful, scenic experience. This is a good option if you’re looking for a more relaxed levada hike in Madeira with a mix of forest and views ideal for a quieter morning in nature. How to Plan Your Levada Hikes in Madeira If you’re planning to tackle some of the best hikes in Madeira, especially the lesser-known levada hikes, here are a few things I’ve learned that will help you have a smoother, more enjoyable experience: 1. Combine car rental with public transportation or arrange a transfer. While renting a car offers great flexibility, parking near levadas and hiking trails can sometimes be difficult. For a smoother experience, consider combining car rental with public transportation. You might also book a hiking guide or arrange a private transfer for the day. That’s what we did for PR6.4 and PR17, and it made managing the one-way routes much easier. 2. Bring Proper Gear Even if a hike seems “easy,” Madeira’s terrain is often uneven, slippery, or steep. I always hike with: • Trail runners or hiking boots with good grip • A waterproof jacket (Madeira’s weather can change quickly) • A headlamp or phone torch for tunnels • Snacks and water 3. Use Maps or Go with a Guide Most levada trails are well-marked, but I still like having a GPS map downloaded just in case (I use the maps.me app). If you’re nervous about navigation, booking a local guide is a great way to explore safely (especially for lesser-walked routes like PR17 and PR6.4). If you’re hiking solo, please make sure to let someone know what you’re doing and where you’re going. 4. Only hike PR routes When choosing levada hikes in Madeira, make sure you’re following the official PR (Pequena Rota) routes. These are government-recognised trails that have been checked and maintained for safety, with proper signage and support infrastructure in place. While there are many unofficial paths on the island, some of them can be poorly maintained and even dangerous, especially near cliffs or in tunnel sections. If it doesn’t start with “PR” and appear on official Madeira hiking maps, skip it. Final Thoughts: Why These Are Some of the Best Hikes in Madeira Madeira has no shortage of incredible trails but these off-the-beaten-path levada hikes are the ones that truly stayed with me. They’re the hikes where I felt immersed in nature and most connected to the island. Walking through misty forests, alongside flowing water, across bridges and through tunnels, often without seeing another soul. So if you’re searching for the best hikes in Madeira that combine beauty, solitude, and just the right amount of adventure, skip the crowds and head to these levadas. These hidden gems are the heart of the island, and they just might become the highlight of your trip."
