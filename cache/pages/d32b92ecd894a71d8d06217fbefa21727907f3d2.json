  "text": "Slightly effervescent or “frizzante” if you’re fancy, with notes of wildflowers, ripe melons and honey followed by flavors of pear, nectarines and apricot. Throw traditional pairing notions out the window, Bartenura Moscato pairs perfectly with whatever you like, especially good company!"
