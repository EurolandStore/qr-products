  "text": "Gmail is entering the Gemini era Today, 3 billion users rely on Gmail to connect and get things done. AI has been a big part of that — from Smart Replies to AI-powered spam blocking. But email has changed considerably since Gmail launched in 2004. With email volume at an all-time high, managing your inbox and the flow of information has become as important as the emails themselves. To help, we're bringing Gmail into the Gemini era and making it your personal, proactive inbox assistant. Ask your inbox anything: AI Overviews Your inbox is full of important information, but accessing it has required you to become a power searcher. And even when you find the right emails, you are often left staring at a list of messages, forced to dig through the text to piece together the answer. That’s why we’re introducing AI Overviews. Just like they do in Google Search, AI Overviews turn information into answers without the digging. When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points. And when you ask your inbox a question, we use Gemini to generate a simple AI Overview with the answer. Instead of hunting for keywords or digging through a year of emails, just use natural language, like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” Gemini’s advanced reasoning pulls the answer, instantly summarizing the exact details you need. AI Overview conversation summaries are rolling out today for everyone at no cost. The ability to ask your inbox questions with AI Overviews is available to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Get an AI Overview with the key details when you ask your inbox to find renovation quotes from a year ago. Get things done faster: Help Me Write, Suggested Replies and Proofread Starting today, everyone can use Help Me Write to polish emails or draft them from scratch. There are also new Suggested Replies (an update to Smart Replies) which use the context of your conversation to offer relevant, one-click responses that match how you write. Say you’re coordinating a family gathering and your aunt replies asking if she should bring cake instead of pie. Suggested Replies can instantly draft an initial response in your tone and style, leaving you free to refine it before giving it your approval. You can also use the new Proofread feature for advanced grammar, tone and style checks so everything is polished before you send. Help Me Write and Suggested Replies are rolling out to everyone at no cost. The Proofread feature is available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. And next month, we'll be updating Help Me Write with better personalization by bringing context from your other Google apps. Suggested Replies and Proofread ensure your emails match how you write and are polished, helping you plan your family gathering faster. See what matters most: AI Inbox Your inbox is filled with updates; some are critical, others are just noise. The new AI Inbox filters out the clutter so you can focus on what’s most important. AI Inbox is like having a personalized briefing, highlighting to-dos and catching you up on what matters. It helps you prioritize, identifying your VIPs based on signals like people you email frequently, those in your contacts list and relationships it can infer from message content. Crucially, this analysis happens securely with the privacy protections you expect from Google, keeping your data under your control. This lets high-stakes items — like a bill due tomorrow or a dentist reminder — rise to the top. We’re giving trusted testers access to AI Inbox before making it more broadly available in the coming months. AI Inbox gives you a snapshot of to-dos from important emails — so you can stay on top of dentist appointments and soccer season. Try the new Gmail today Many of these improvements are made possible by Gemini 3. These new capabilities begin rolling out today in the U.S. to Gmail users as well as Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. We're starting with English and excited to roll out more languages and to more regions in the coming months."
