  "text": "Latest Release - JAN 30, 2026 - 24 songs Essential Albums Artist Playlists Singles & EPs About Yes As the premier band of prog rockâs first wave, Yes reshaped the rock template, twisting it into challenging new shapes that inspired an entire genre. Forming in London in 1968, the group built upon the explorations of psychedelia, incorporating jazz and classical influences, unusual (for rock) time signatures, complex song structures, heady lyrical themes, and instrumental virtuosity. Its third and fourth albums, 1971âs The Yes Album and Fragile, broke the band internationally and became prog milestones. Jon Andersonâs airy tenor, Chris Squireâs thick, high-register bass lines, Steve Howeâs mad-scientist guitar, Bill Brufordâs deft, jazzy drumming, and (on Fragile) Rick Wakemanâs rococo keyboard flourishes all contributed to the classic Yes sound. Numerous personnel and style shifts occurred over the years, most notably the bandâs New Wave-tinged â80s rebirth with the blockbuster single âOwner of a Lonely Heart.â Yes marched on through it all, touring and releasing new music into the 2020s, and providing a template for generations of progressive rockers along the way. - FROM - London, England - FORMED - 1968 - GENRE - Rock"
