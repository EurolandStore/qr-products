Christopher Showed up on time, Had good communication A very detailed pre-purchase inspection and test drive with photos! answered all my post inspection questions & was very polite Great all the way around I will use this service again! Many Thanks! Andy T Christopher was very friendly and answered all of my questions. Love the convenience of someone coming to the house and he is close by so will be using him for all my future oil changes! Thanks for the great service! He was available way earlier than anticipated, and completed the work before when the original appointment time was scheduled. Overall, I’d say that’s pretty good service! It's was early for our appt. He went right to it after verifying it was indeed my alternator. He was very friendly and very courteous and very knowledgeable. I would recommend Your Mechanic to my friends. Jose is the most friendly and professional mechanic. He cares about your vehicle like it was his. He found the problem and explained inmediately what the solution was. Once we agreed, he went to work and was fixed correctly in record time. I made a new friend. Excellent job Jose. Having done similar work on a same engine, Jose was able to do the task (replacing ignition coils and spark plugs) without removing the intake manifold. That avoided potential unnecessary complications, and I greatly appreciate. He was early, polite, and a straight shooter. That is all anyone can ask for. I am very satisfied with Jose's service thus far. He will be returning to repair my car Thursday. Very punctual, knowledgeable, and friendly mechanic. Went into detail about my cars issies, and what may need to be done outside of paid services. Would recommend. John completed a radiator inspection. He was thorough and professional throughout the inspection. John was knowledgeable and he explained the details of my raidator problem and I understood the repairs, labor and parts needed. Overall John did a great job. Keith was amazing. He showed up on time, was personable and extremely knowledgeable. The service was quick and clean. I will definitely recommend Keith to anyone. Having him come to our house was super convenient as well. Very friendly, patient, and hands on! Showed up a bit earlier than expected, which i liked as well! I will book again for all needs Arturo was on time, very friendly, efficient and didn’t mind me asking questions, He actually welcomed the questions which made me feel comfortable with my vehicle since this is the first time not taking it to the dealership. Honest, trustworthy, knowledgeable. Arturo was able to quickly identify the issue with my car. He had the tools to run different tests on hand and was able to nail the problem right away. I recommend him 100% based on my experience. It is not easy to find somebody with his level of expertise to work on a Mercedes these days. I am a happy customer. Very kind, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to explain any and all car issues. Took his time to make sure my car was taken care of. Would book again! Great communication, knowledgeable, and efficient. Explained things in an easily interpreted way while working on vehicle to keep me informed. First time using Your Mechanic, will use again due to Roland’s service. Jason was great! Very professional and did a great job helping me understand the issues with my car and the different options I had. I would absolutely recommend him! Jason was courteous, prompt and professional . He did a very good job and i will definitely recommend/use in the future. Great experience, Welcome to YourMechanic, where we're all about making vehicle service easy and accessible.
