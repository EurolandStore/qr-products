  "text": "Cruises from San Juan, Puerto Rico offer a magical blend of natural island charm and man-made wonders. Historic San Juan, once nothing more than cobblestone streets and the distinctive architecture of the Spanish who founded it, is now a modern world capital. And, as you’ll see on Carnival’s cruises from Puerto Rico, it’s kept these classical features! Among the peaceful shaded courtyards and commanding colonial fortresses of El Morro and San Cristobal, urban explorers will find a cosmopolitan city of wide boulevards, lively cafés, highly-regarded galleries and designer boutiques… not to mention gold-sand beaches and nearby rainforest jungles. San Juan, Puerto Rico is where the old world meets the new — and you can enjoy them both when you choose one of our cruises from San Juan. Hashtag your cruise photos #carnival and #sanjuan — you may see them right here."
