  "text": "What Does Halal Mean? Halal refers to food allowed under Islamic law, while foods that aren't allowed are called haram. With so many diverse cultures around the world, it's important to offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs, such as including halal food on your menu or at your next event. Being considerate of these needs helps make sure everyone feels included. Halal isnât just about what food you eat but also how animals are treated during butchering. The process requires minimal suffering for the animal and reciting God's name as the animal is sacrificed. It's also important to remember that Islamic scholars may have varying opinions on halal. Some Muslims extend halal and haram beyond food, avoiding certain alcohol-based products such as perfumes or soaps made from lard. In the U.S., it can be hard to identify products that might not be halal. For instance, some perfumes contain pork by-products, and certain desserts might include alcohol. History of Halal Halal food guidelines come from three main sources. The first is the Qur'an, which gives clear rules about what is allowed or forbidden. The second is hadiths, which are stories and teachings from the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The third source is the rulings of Islamic scholars, who use their knowledge of the Qur'an and hadiths to decide what is considered halal. In the U.S., there wasnât always a focus on meeting the dietary needs of different cultures. But now, many larger cities offer a wide variety of halal products to serve the growing Muslim population. You can even find apps and databases that help you locate halal food and restaurants nearby. Halal vs. Kosher Some compare halal dietary rules to kosher dietary laws since they have some similarities, but there are also key differences. Both Muslims and Jews avoid eating pork and blood, and they both allow cattle. But, kosher rules are usually stricter, especially when it comes to how animals are butchered, how food is prepared, and who can eat it. For example, Muslims can eat kosher meat, but many Jewish people (especially those who are orthodox) do not consider halal meat to be kosher. Jewish law also requires only a trained Jewish man to perform the butchering. Although there are other similarities and differences between kosher and halal, the main common ground is the focus on how animals are treated during butchering and the types of meat allowed in their diets. What Are Halal Foods? Halal food must not contain any ingredients from haram sources. You must also use utensils and equipment that havenât come into contact with haram substances. Once you follow these rules, the following food and drink products can be considered halal: - Seafood, including fish - Bread products - Pastry items, such as frostings - Desserts, including cakes and pastries - Cereals, including breakfast, organic, and natural - Rice - Pasta - Dairy products, such as drink mixes and whipped toppings - Milk, as long as it's from a halal source - Cheese and cheese products - Ice cream - EggsÂ - Coffee mixes and tea blendsÂ - Seasonings - Fruits, both fresh and dried - Juices - Honey - Syrups - Jams and jellies - Legumes - Nuts - Peanut butter - Pizzas, as long as it has halal meats and vegetables - Vegetables, both frozen and fresh - Processed potatoes, such as french fries - Sauces and dressing - Soups and soup bases - Tofu - Halal deli meats What Are Haram Foods? Haram foods include pork and animals that hunt with fangs or claws, such as lions or falcons. Alcohol is also haram, and drinking it is forbidden in Islam. While some Muslims avoid pork, pork lard, and alcohol and consider that enough to follow halal rules, others believe that the meat must also be butchered according to Islamic guidelines. It's important to check labels for any haram ingredients. Here's a general list of haram foods: - Pork and its by-products, including gelatin, lipase, pepsin - Meat from animals not butchered according to Islamic dietary law - Alcohol and foods prepared with alcohol, such as rum cake - Foods with pure or artificial vanilla extract, as vanilla is made with alcohol - Foods with blood or blood by-products, such as blood pudding - Foods made with whey prepared with nonmicrobial enzyme, rennet, animal shortening, monoglycerides and diglycerides from an animal source, sodium stearoyl lactylate, and L-cysteine How Is Halal Meat Prepared? Islamic law requires that animals you intend to eat be butchered in a specific way to meet halal standards. Muslims consider halal butchering one of the more humane methods in the meat industry, and it's the only method they accept. The person tasked with butchering must ensure the animal is from an allowed category, alive at the time, and killed with a sharp knife in a single stroke. A Muslim must carry out the slaughter while saying Allah's name. You must store and process halal meat separately from non-halal products and avoid using equipment that processes non-halal animals, such as pork.Â The process focuses on easing the animal's suffering by offering it water and keeping it out of sight from other animals before butchering. How to Make Halal Food Before preparing halal food, you must take steps to ensure you follow halal rules. These include: - Cleaning all utensils, glasses, crockery, serving dishes, and surfaces where you'll prepare food - Reserving a chopping board, prep area, and knife for halal meat - Separating halal and non-halal meat into different containers - Avoiding cooking halal and non-halal meat in the same cookware - Placing halal meat on the top rack of the oven and non-halal meat on the bottom - Serving halal and non-halal meat separately - Clearly identifying halal meat - Using separate serving utensils for halal and non-halal meat - Preparing fried foods only in vegetable oil - Serving salads only with halal meat and cheese - Using only margarine and vegetable oils when making biscuits, cakes, and other desserts How to Find Halal Foods When Eating Out Many Muslims face the challenge of eating halal while dining out. Here are some simple tips to help: Do your research. Before eating out, research restaurants and whether they serve halal food options. Some apps and websites even list halal restaurants around the world. Go pescatarian, vegan, or vegetarian. When halal options are limited, opt for seafood, vegan, or vegetarian dishes. Most Islamic laws consider them halal. Just be cautious about cross-contamination at restaurants. Recognize the halal logo. Look for halal certification logos, but use your judgment for places that advertise halal without certification. Do your research to verify their claims. Avoid processed foods. Processed foods can have unknown ingredients. To avoid doubt, stick to whole, simple, and nutritious options. How to Host Someone With Halal Dietary Restrictions Preparing halal meals is not just about meeting dietary needs; itâs a way to show respect and inclusivity. Understanding and following halal guidelines can create a welcoming environment for your guests. Take some time to learn about halal ingredients and cooking methods. This will help you make tasty and authentic halal meals your guests will enjoy. Also, ask your guests for their favorite halal recipes or meal suggestions, dietary preferences, and specific restrictions. Theyâll likely appreciate your effort. When buying meat and other products, look for halal-certified options to make sure they meet halal standards. Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and cookware for halal cooking to avoid cross-contamination. Â Takeaways Halal, meaning \"lawful\" in Islamic teachings, refers to food and drink that Muslims are allowed to have. Anything that doesnât meet these guidelines is considered haram or \"not permitted.\" Halal is about more than avoiding certain foods such as pork and alcohol. It also covers how animals are treated and slaughtered, requiring minimal suffering and the mention of Godâs name during the process. If you plan to serve halal food, it's helpful to talk to Muslims about their preferences and best practices for preparing these meals."
