  "text": "Hi there! 'preferred' and 'prefered' ... Are they both correct? According to the rule found here: post 10813 Travelling/Traveling In American English, in a multisyllabic word with a final consonant directly preceded by a single vowel, that consonant does not get doubled if the stress does not fall on the last syllable. ...
