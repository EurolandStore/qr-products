  "text": "Palantir (PLTR) – Earnings Beat & Technical Setup Palantir (PLTR) delivered a huge earnings beat today — not just on revenue and EPS, but with forward guidance that far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Q4 2025 Numbers: - Revenue: $1.41B (vs. $1.33B expected) - Adj EPS: $0.25 (vs. $0.23 expected) - Q1 2026 Guide: $1.53B–$1.54B (vs. $1.34B expected) - FY 2026 Guide: $7.18B–$7.20B (vs. $6.27B expected) That’s nearly $1 billion higher than Street consensus for the year ahead. Now the big question is whether there’s a technical setup for traders, or has the easy money already been made? In the video above, I break down: - The daily chart and how price responded to the earnings - Support zones that matter if PLTR pulls back - Bullish trade setup: where I’d look to get long, and where I’d place risk Palantir may be pricing in a lot of future growth already, but with this kind of guidance and a clean technical chart, it could still offer a solid breakout setup.
