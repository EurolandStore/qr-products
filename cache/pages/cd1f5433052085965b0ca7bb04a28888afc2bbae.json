  "text": "Colonia (Mexico) Appearance In Mexican urban geography, colonias (Spanish pronunciation: [koˈlonjas]) are barrios.[1] The name of the colonia must be specified when writing a postal address in Mexican cities. Usually colonias are assigned a specific postal code; nonetheless, in recent urban developments, gated communities are also defined as colonias and share the postal code of adjacent neighborhoods. Colonias do not have jurisdictional autonomy or representation."
