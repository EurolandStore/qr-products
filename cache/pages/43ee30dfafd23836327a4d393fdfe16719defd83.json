RatingPrice TargetTuesday was the third straight day when alpha came in the form of \"smaller\" technology stocks as well as a broad spectrum of mid- and small-cap issues. Tuesday was the third straight day when alpha came in the form of \"smaller\" technology stocks as well as a broad spectrum of mid- and small-cap issues. The S&P 500 tacked on another 0.6%, finishing at a minor all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, the Nasdaq added 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 added almost 1% -- but the two have yet to advance to an ATH. Relative strength was seen in the S&P Mid-Cap (at an ATH) and S&P Small-Cap (closing in on an ATH), which both popped 1.5%. Once again, individual stock performance was spectacular, to say the least. The leading tech stocks in the S&P 500 remain on fire, with SNDK (+27%), WDC (+17%), STX (+14%), MCHP (+12%), MU and NXPI (+10%), TXN (+8.5%), Q (+7%), and LRCX (+6%) leading the charge. The top three gainers are from the tech hardware-storage & peripherals industry, with WDC and STX exploding since April and SNDK spiking since September. Individual technology names in the S&P 400 were again huge winners, with NOVT, LITE, ALGM, CIEN, SYNA, PATH, SLAB, ENTG, AMKR, LSCC, and RRX all jumping between 6% and 12%. These are certainly not household names in tech, as the AI trade might be heading underground. The S&P Technology sector (XLK) was the third best of the 11 sectors on Tuesday, rising 1.4%. In comparison, the Equal-Weight S&P Technology sector (RSPT) led that index, bursting higher by 3%. The Small-Cap Tech sector (PSCT) tacked on 2.2%. Elsewhere, the S&P Healthcare sector (XLV +2%) came back to life, fueled by medical equipment (ISRG, SYK, MDT, A) and biotech (VRTX, ILMN, INCY, and GMAB). Both ILMN and INCY were recent technical stock selections in this report. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 01/05/2026: Argus' Most-Followed Stocks in 2025 This week's list looks at the 20 stocks followed most closely by Argus clients in 2025. It contains well-known names and, not surprisingly, includes many technology or \"technology related\" names. One might have easily guessed that Nvidia is in the top spot, but might be surprised to see only three Healthcare companies, only one big box retailer, no big banks, and no Walmart. The list also includes the current Argus rating on each stock, the sector for each stock, and each stock's performance from 2025. The Argus Sustainable Growth Theme Model Portfolio Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead."
