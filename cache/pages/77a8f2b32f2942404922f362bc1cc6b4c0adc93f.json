If you have any further questions please let me know. 0 - Re: \"If you log into Spectrum.net and click on Email at the top of the page this will allow you to access your Email\". As I said in my original post, the link to Email no longer exists at the top of the spectrum.net page. 0 - Did you try the second link that goes directly to Spectrum Webmail? 0 - Yes, the direct link to spectrum email works. But I would would like to use the link from the spectrum.net home page. Any idea why I no longer see that link? I have a chartertn.net email address, if that makes a difference. 0 - I am seeing the email link available when accessing our test account and I am not aware of any recent changes or updates that would impact the Spectrum.net page. Have you tried a different browser and / or clearing the browser history & cache ? If the issue continues, you can submit feedback about the webpage directly to the web team for further investigation, using the feedback icon on the left of the page. 0 - I get exactly the same results with Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Clearing browser history and cache doesn't change what I'm seeing. I suspect it has something to do with the chartertn.net domain. Thanks for your help. 0 - I submitted this issue to the web team for investigation via webpage feedback. Thanks again. 2"
