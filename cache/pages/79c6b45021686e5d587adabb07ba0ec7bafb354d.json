  "text": "Sargento Sargento Foods Inc. is an American food producer best known for its cheese. It was founded in 1953 in Plymouth, Wisconsin by Leonard Gentine and Joseph Sartori.[1][2] The company name is a combination of Sartori and Gentine, with an \"o\" added to make the name sound Italian, as the company specialized in Italian-style cheeses.[3][4] Sargento is one of the largest privately held companies in the United States,[5] and is one of the country's largest retail cheese companies.[6] The company offers profit sharing, tuition reimbursement and benefits for its employees.[7] The company has been a sponsor in American motorsports for many years;[8] for example, it is prominently displayed on Road America raceway.[9][10] Corporate overview [edit]Sargento has 5 different locations, all of them being in Wisconsin. It has over 2,500 employees in total.[11] Products [edit]Sargento was the first company to sell pre-packaged sliced cheese (1953), to sell pre-packaged shredded cheeses (1958),[12] and the first to develop zippered packaging for its cheeses (2001).[13][14] The company also produces and markets specialty cheeses, which it purveys on its website and in catalogs.[15] Additional products include sauces, snack cheeses and snack foods, and the company also manufactures custom cheese and food products for corporate clients.[15] In early 2017, Sargento recalled seven cheeses for possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination.[16] Works [edit]- Faley, Tom (April 10, 2018).
