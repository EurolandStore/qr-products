  "text": "I was reading this article in regards to the communities in Yates County: https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-...sh-mennonites/ This portion of the article from 2018 caught my eye: “ In the past decade, the state has experienced the fastest growth of Amish and Mennonites in the country, said Judson Reid, an agriculture specialist at Cornell University who studies the two groups. In New York the groups have a combined population of about 24,000, the fifth-largest in the United States. The state has seen an influx of Amish and Mennonites from Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states, attracted by affordable and productive farmland, Reid said.” I know that there are communities of one or the other, if not both in counties such as Lewis(surnames such as Widrick and Zehr are common surnames among that county, including Mennonites), Jefferson, Oswego and St. Lawrence. I’ve also seen them in Syracuse to go to the hospital or the CNY Regional Market. Some are in the Finger Lakes Region as well(Yates County has quite a few). Has anyone else noticed an uptick in their portion of the state of one or both of these groups? Does anyone know any personally that was once in either one of these groups? What has your relationship been with either one of these groups(haven’t had an issue in small interactions)?
