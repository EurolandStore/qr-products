  "text": "In Indian trains does Second Sitting (2S) offer reserved / guaranteed seating? Hey everyone, I'm looking to book a ticket on a train called the Vaigai Express and the seating options I see are Second Sitting (2S) and AC Chair Car (CC) which is waitlisted for the date I wish to travel on. I would like to book 2S but I would prefer to have a seat number so I know that I have a place to sit (and take a nap) rather than sit in one of those coaches which seem to have bench like seats. I'll be getting on the train at a later station and I don't want to end up standing for a couple of hours. Just looking for some advice, thanks!"
