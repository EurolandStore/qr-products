  "text": "Andy is an Android emulator that lets you download, install, and use hundreds of thousands of apps exclusive to Android on your Windows PC, all without having to set up a virtual machine or go through a complex setup process. Just install and start using it. Andy is incredibly intuitive: using the mouse cursor as you would do with your finger, even scrolling the mouse wheel when you'd usually swipe down with your fingertip. In other words, you won't have any problems whatsoever when you get behind the emulator's controls. In terms of compatibility, Andy is truly spectacular. Users can install the emulator and play virtually any game with no problem, like Clash of Clans, Candy Crush Saga, Fruit Ninja, Plants Vs Zombies 2, or The Sims, to name just a (very) few. That said, perhaps the best part is that Andy also lets you use IM tools like WhatsApp or WhatsApp Plus. All you have to do to use them is identify yourself with your phone number, and then you can start using WhatsApp on Windows. Andy is an outstanding Android emulator, reminiscent in many ways of the also excellent BlueStacks but with some additional improvements. When all's said and done, a very convenient way to use any Android app on your usual computer."
