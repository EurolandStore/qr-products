Whether you are looking for a charming one bedroom beach bungalow on the sand for a romantic getaway, or a twelve bedroom oceanfront luxurious mansion for your family reunion, we are sure to have the place for you! View our California vacation rentals and read why you should rent with Beachfront Only What better place to stay on the beach than in sunny Southern California! Our beach vacation rentals are all located in close proximity to California’s major attractions. The San Diego Zoo, Safari Park, Legoland, Seaworld, Disneyland, and Universal Studios are an easy day trip for you and your family. Our California beach rentals are all located in North County San Diego, which is approximately 30 minutes north of Downtown San Diego. Western North County is made up of quaint coastal towns, each with their own vibe and that laid back California beach essence that everyone loves. Our rentals are in the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas, and Oceanside (Oceanside being the northernmost San Diego town). First of all the people at Beachfront are some of the best people I have worked with. They are beyond nice and responsive. Very much appreciated them and their professionalism. We really enjoyed the property we stayed at. Just four days prior to our planned getaway we were advised by another property owner we had made reservations that our reservation had been cancelled. We were quite distraught as our whole family party had made arrangements for travel and had purchased venue tickets. We were able to secure this property for our family with only a few days notice. Again, the Beachfront people were awesome to work with us. The property has superb views overlooking the ocean; a perfect gathering place for our family. The kids loved the hot tub! The parking was perfect for our vehicles. I would certainly recommend it to others. Just a note on the amenities – bring your own beach equipment (boogie boards and such, as there are none available at the property). We did have a few issues with some of the doors not working, but Beachfront was there to assist us in remedying the issues. It really was a great venue for us. Thanks! I\\’ve been staying with beech front for a couple of years now. Each time I usually pick a different property just because they are all so beautiful and are dog friendly. But my heart always brings me back to this beautiful little house. There is no other get away that encompasses everything this property encompasses. waking up to the roaring ocean is my absolute favorite. The properties are always clean and beautiful! And the staff is so attentive if anything is ever needed. Thank you so much beachfront!!! We loved our stay. It was so nice being right next to the water and being able to go to the beach without hauling everything to the car and driving. The views were beautiful. We had no issues with noise. We couldn’t figure out the air but did not call maintenance because we just left the doors open and it was cool outside. The panoramic doors/windows are amazing. Communication was excellent and they responded right away when we had questions. Kitchen was stocked with what we needed. Will definitely come back in the future! My family and friends were so impressed with this rental. We have stayed at many vacation rentals, and this by far is one of the best. Beachfront Only truly thought of everything. The home was well stocked, very clean, and the beds were so comfortable. We are already planning our next trip with Beachfront Only. We love this rental and Beachfront as a property manager. The rental is super spacious and perfectly located on the beach just a block away from the Carlsbad Village. We also appreciated that management affirmatively checked in with us the morning after we checked in to make sure that we had everything we needed and there were no issues with the property. We will definitely continue to rent this property for our annual trip to Carlsbad. A wonderful stay as always! Best place ever to be on “lock-down.” 🙂 Thank you for continuing to keep lower cost units so we can keep coming.
