  "text": "So I had a date planned tonight with a woman I met online. Over the weekend we talked on the phone for a few hours and the conversation was good, with a few random texts over the following days. After not hearing from her yesterday, I texted around 7:00 last night with a simple: “Hi, hope you’re having a pleasant evening, just checking to see that we’re still on for tomorrow.” Then I was left on read overnight. This morning, after no response and two unanswered texts I said “Your silence leads me to believe you may have changed your mind. It was nice talking to you, good luck with your search” And even before I hit send, I knew what was going to happen. I was going to get a text making it my fault. I jumped the gun. She was just about to text or call. She was picking out what to wear! There would be something - a car accident, a sick pet, a dying neighbor, a trailer fire, that made responding “yes/no” within 12 hours an impossibility. She did, of course, have every intention of meeting me that evening until my unwarranted “overreaction” to her silence. I was clearly the problem and we were simply incompatible. My gut is usually correct. I clicked “send” I got the response I predicted, almost immediately. She said spent the evening in urgent care. She had just seen my first text (that was “read” 14 hours earlier) and was responding with an enthusiastic “yes” when my second text came in. Now, however, with my unstable and mercurial personality revealed, she thinks we are incompatible. I wish that, when ghosting, people would just let it go and not try to make it the other person’s fault. You got caught. It’s cool. Let it go. Anyone else run into this tactic?"
