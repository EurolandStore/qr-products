  "text": "We’re shaping the way for resilient, beautiful, self-sustaining communities in Puerto Rico and beyond. We build with steel, upcycled shipping containers that are fire and wind resistant in cases of high-intensity natural disasters like fires, earthquakes, and hurricanes, withstanding up to 200 mph wind gusts. We include rainwater collection and potabilization systems, as well as biogarden septic systems, to ensure long-term water accessibility in case of disaster. We enable spaces to be self-sustaining with off-grid capabilities like solar power. KONTi Design Build Studio began with a mission to create sustainable, cost-effective solutions for our communities. Today, our eco-friendly designs don’t just adapt to the environment—they enhance it. Our solutions offer you greater efficiency, lower utility costs, and long-term resilience. With smart resource management and durable materials, you can count on healthier spaces, reduced maintenance, and a stronger return on investment. Konti was born from post-hurricane reconstruction efforts in Puerto Rico. We recognized the urgent need for affordable housing and the development of sustainable, resilient, and cost-effective structures. Since then, we’ve leveraged our expertise in modular construction to help rebuild and fortify vulnerable communities. Carla is a third-generation Puerto Rican architect. She founded KONTi Design Build Studio after witnessing the catastrophic impact of Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017. Carla envisioned communities that were resilient and self-sustaining in the face of disasters. While she first focused on ensuring that structures could withstand hurricanes, using upcycled shipping containers as a base structure, her vision has evolved to address sustainable and resilient living for a broad range of natural disasters."
