  "text": "sex sex, the sum of features by which members of species can be divided into two groups—male and female—that complement each other reproductively. Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are all closely woven into the fabric of living things. All relate to the propagation of the race and the survival of the species. Yet there can be sex without sexuality, and reproduction need not be sexual, although for most forms of life sexual reproduction is essential for both propagation and long-term survival. Sexual and nonsexual reproduction Because the life span of all individual forms of life, from microbes to man, is limited, the first concern of any particular population is to produce successors. This is reproduction, pure and simple. Among lower animals and plants it may be accomplished without involving eggs and sperm. Ferns, for example, shed millions of microscopic, nonsexual spores, which are capable of growing into new plants if they settle in a suitable environment. Many higher plants also reproduce by nonsexual means. Bulbs bud off new bulbs from the side. Certain jellyfish, sea anemones, marine worms, and other lowly creatures bud off parts of the body during one season or another, each thereby giving rise to populations of new, though identical, individuals. At the microscopic level, single-celled organisms reproduce continually by growing and dividing successively to give rise to enormous populations of mostly identical descendants. All such reproduction depends on the capacity of cells to grow and divide, which is a basic property of life. In the case of most animals, however, particularly the higher forms, reproduction by nonsexual means is apparently incompatible with the structural complexity and activity of the individual. Although nonsexual reproduction is exploited by some creatures to produce very large populations under certain circumstances, it is of limited value in terms of providing the variability necessary for adaptive advantages. Such so-called vegetative forms of reproduction, whether of animals or plants, result in individuals that are genetically identical with the parent. If some adverse environmental change should occur, all would be equally affected and none might survive. At the best, therefore, nonsexual reproduction can be a valuable and perhaps an essential means of propagation, but it does not exclude the need for sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction not only takes care of the need for replacement of individuals within a population but gives rise to populations better suited to survive under changing circumstances. In effect it is a kind of double assurance that the race or species will persist for an indefinite time. The great difference between the two types of reproduction is that individual organisms resulting from nonsexual reproduction have but a single parent and are essentially alike, whereas those resulting from sexual reproduction have two parents and are never exact replicas of either. Sexual reproduction thus introduces a variability, in addition to its propagative function. Both types of reproduction represent the capacity of individual cells to develop into whole organisms, given suitable circumstances. Sex is therefore something that has been combined with this primary function and is responsible for the capacity of a race to adapt to new environmental conditions. Sex cells The term sex is variously employed. In the broad sense it includes everything from the sex cells to sexual behaviour. Primary sex, which is generally all that distinguishes one kind of individual from another in the case of many lower animals, denotes the capacity of the reproductive gland, or gonad, to produce either sperm cells or eggs or both. If only sperm cells are produced, the reproductive gland is a testis, and the primary sex of the tissue and the individual possessing it is male. If only eggs are produced, the reproductive gland is an ovary, and the primary sex is female. If the gland produces both sperm and eggs, either simultaneously or successively, the condition is known as hermaphroditic. An individual, therefore, is male or female or hermaphrodite primarily according to the nature of the gonad. - Related Topics: - sex chromosome - female - sex differentiation - sex reversal - male As a rule, male and female complement each other at all levels of organization: as sex cells; as individuals with either testes or ovaries; and as individuals with anatomical, physiological, and behavioral differences associated with the complemental roles they play during the whole reproductive process. The role of the male individual is to deliver sperm cells in enormous numbers in the right place and at the right time to fertilize eggs of female individuals of the same species. The role of the female individual is to deliver or otherwise offer eggs capable of being fertilized under precise circumstances. In the case of hermaphrodite organisms, animal or plant, various devices are employed to ensure cross-fertilization, or cross-pollination, so that full advantage of double parentage is obtained. The basic requirement of sexual reproduction is that reproductive cells of different parentage come together and fuse in pairs. Such cells will be genetically different to a significant degree, and it is this feature that is essential to the long-term well-being of the race. The other sexual distinctions, between the two types of sex cell and between two individuals of different sex, are secondary differences connected with ways and means of attaining the end."
