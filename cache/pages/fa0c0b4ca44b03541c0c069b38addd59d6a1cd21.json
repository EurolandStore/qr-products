  "text": "Welcome to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and home to one of the largest castles in the world! Nicknamed ‘city of a hundred spires’, although, in reality, the skyline has thousands, typical of the city’s gothic architecture. There are so many things to do in Prague, that you can spend at least 3 days here discovering its history, wandering the charming cobblestone streets, eating delicious food, and admiring the fairytale architecture. Day 1 – The Old and the New Spend your first day enjoying the beautiful contrasts of Prague. From the ancient old town, with its traditional atmosphere, to the modern and abstract ‘Dancing House’. Good to know: Everything on this day is within walking distance of each other! 1. Old Town (Stare Mesto) The old town of Prague is the heart and soul of the city. Not least, because of its history and preservation, which have made it a world-famous UNESCO World Heritage site. Over a thousand years of history has been preserved here through religious buildings, monuments, and houses. The main old town square is beautiful at all times of the year, but it’s particularly impressive in December. At this time, the square fills up with festive Christmas markets! Also visit: Charming Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic Astronomical Clock Surprisingly, the top thing to do in the old town is to pay a visit to the unique astronomical clock. Every hour, on the hour, the clock chimes, and mechanical figures march out. The legend goes that the Prague councilors were so proud of this clock that they burnt the clockmaker’s eyes out to prevent another being created elsewhere. Despite this, there is now an exact replica in Seoul, South Korea! 2. Jewish Quarter (Josefov) Unlike many other Jewish neighborhoods in Europe, the Jewish Quarter in Prague was not destroyed in the war. This is because Hitler aimed to eliminate the Jews and then later retire to Prague and make the district a museum. Thankfully, Hitler failed, and the area is now a UNESCO-protected site. Not only because it was the largest Jewish ghetto in Europe but also because of the Jewish Museum that is located here. During the holocaust, when all Jewish residents were sent to concentration camps, their belongings were stored here. In the Jewish Quarter, visit the museum, the cemetery, the Jubilee, and the stunning Spanish synagogue with a Moorish interior! Discover more: Moorish architecture in Valencia, Spain 4. River Vltava London has the Thames, Paris the Seine, and Prague the River Vltava! It is the longest river in the country and also passes through the wonderful city of Cesky Krumlov. Join a boat tour or go kayaking on the river to have the best view of the city. 5. Dancing House Arguably, the most eye-catching building is this weird, twisted building named the Dancing House, a collaboration between a Czech and Canadian architect. It symbolizes yin and yang; in this situation, the coming together of communism and democracy. 6. Mala Strana (The Little Quarter) Mala Strana, a charming hilly district that sits on the river banks, is the must-visit neighborhood in Prague. Here, visitors can discover luxurious, brightly colored townhouses and elegant gardens as a result of its position beneath the castle. Visit the stunning Waldstein Garden (free) and the Gardens below Prague Castle (~ 2 EUR) that offer a view over the city. Additionally, the Lennon Wall is a wall covered in graffiti in honor of John Lennon and his pacifism. Now, it is home to political art and slogans that aim to spread love and peace. Tip: On your way to the castle, pass through Thunovsky street; a spectacularly well preserved medieval street with three intricately painted arches. 7. Prague Castle Delve into one of the world’s largest castles! Prague Castle made it into the Guinness World Book of Records for its size, and you can visit the following sites inside: Royal Palace The Royal Palace was built in 1135 and used by Czech Princesses, Kings, and Queens throughout the ages. Opening Times & Entrance Fees Prague Castle The castle grounds are open from 6 AM to 10 PM every day and can be entered for free. However, to visit the monuments, a ticket is required. Skip lines and book your tickets online. The monuments open at 9 am but arrive on time as there will be a queue at the ticket office. Visitors can choose from circuits A, B, or C, depending on the monuments they want to see. We did Circuit B (the most popular tour at the price of 250 CZK or 9.5 EUR), which includes St Vitus Cathedral, Golden Lane, George’s Basilica, and the Old Royal Palace. Book a tour and ticket online. Note: Please check opening times on the official castle website, as opening times vary by monument and season. 8. Charles Bridge Right before sunset, cross over the famous Charles Bridge: a charming cobbled, pedestrians-only gateway from the old town across to Mala Strana and the castle. Built in 1357, the Charles Bridge features 30 statues that represent saints from Czech history. Nowadays, it is occupied by artists and musicians and is simply fantastic for a stroll. Close by the bridge is the narrowest street in Prague, measuring in at only 50cm wide! It even has its own traffic light to prevent people from walking into each other. Day 3 – Outside Prague The countryside around Prague is spectacular! Explore lakes, canyons, and castles with all the things to do on day 3. 9. Saturday Farmers Market Start your day off right by visiting the Naplavka farmers market! The market is located here and is a great thing to do in Prague on a Saturday morning. Wander along the riverbanks, discovering all the stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as delicious bread, pastries, and coffee. Delicious! Note: Only on Saturdays. 10. Karlstejn Castle Just 40 minutes driving from Prague is the spectacular Karlstejn Castle, one of the most famous castles in the Czech Republic! The gothic castle sits nestled in the forest-covered hills above the charming village below. How to get there: If you are doing the Czech road trip by car, then you can drive to the castle in 40 minutes from Prague. You can also reach the town by the castle in about an hour by train. Once in the village of Karlstejn, it is a 20-minute uphill walk to the castle. We recommend to rent a car in Czech Republic through Sunny Cars with free cancellation and insurance included. Book your rental car here. 11. Great Quarry America From Karlstejn, definitely take a hike or ride to the great quarry of America. ‘Velka Amerika’ is its name in Czech; however, it is widely known as the Czech Grand Canyon. Walk amongst the countryside for 45 minutes from Karlstejn Castle before arriving at this incredible limestone canyon with an 18-meter deep lake at the base. Also visit: Karlovy Vary, the Spa town of the Czech Republic 12. A day trip to Cesky Krumlov As an alternative, do a day trip to the medieval town Cesky Krumlov. The picturesque setting of Cesky Krumlov, with a huge ‘Disney style’ castle and horseshoe bend river, is what Cesky Krumlov is famous for.
