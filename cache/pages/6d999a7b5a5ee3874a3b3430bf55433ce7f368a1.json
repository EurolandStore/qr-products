  "text": "Canadian Marlboro: what to know! - People would expect Rooftops to be the \"real\" Marlboro, as they are made by RBH, which is a subdiary of Philip Morris. However, RBH seems to use more or less the same virginia blend for all his brands. Rooftop don't really taste like Marlboros. - The brand name Marlboro belongs to Imperial Tobacco Canada, which now makes 2 variants of his brands with Burley, Oriental and Virginia tobacco. According to its website marlboro(dot)ca, those to variants are: A) Marlboro B) Marlboro Smooth The two other variants (Marlboro Full and Marlboro Select) only contain 10% burley) In summary, even if Marlboro and Marlboro Smooth brand names are not made by PMI, they are closer to the American ones. The main difference is that Canada has forbidden every additives in cigarettes, so our cigarettes will never have the same sweetness and characteristic odor. (Camels and Winstons are also close, but they are amongst the most expensive cigarettes, unfortunately!)"
