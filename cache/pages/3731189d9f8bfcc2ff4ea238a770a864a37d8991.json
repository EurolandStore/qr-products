This allows us to offer phone number lookup service to anyone free of charge. We believe in information transparency and hopefully, you will find our service useful. Name Lookup by Phone Number Zlookup only needs an active phone number to perform name search. We not only search our own phone number databases, we also request mobile phone companies to return phone owner's name. If the phone number is not active, we might not be able to return any useful information. Also if the mobile phone is owned and paid for the person's employer, you will see the employer's name in the result. We believe that we provide the most up to date phone ownership information that can be had online. Please let your friends and family know about our service - we only ask that you share our service if you like it. How else can I lookup phone numbers? The only other free way to looking up owner's name for a phone number is by just searching for the phone number on google. If the phone number is listed on any website that has been indexed by google, you will be able to see the web page. This does not guarantee that you will be able to find out who the owner of the phone number is. If the phone number belongs to a business, you will be able to find the business name and location by google search. If the phone number belongs to an individual, the odds of finding any related content to the phone number is very low. Your best bet would be to use Zlookup to lookup phone numbers. What is a free reverse phone number lookup? Reverse phone number lookup means the ability to locate the owner information by using just a phone number. Zlookup is the only internet company that allows people across the world to freely and accurately lookup phone owners in under a minute. Most other services either do not report accurate information or are just not free. How is our reverse lookup free? If you are wondering how we are able to offer free reverse lookup service - know that we are not here to make money. Our goal is to minimize phone abuse and enable people to find out who called them. We were frustrated by getting random calls and never being able to find out who the caller was. We wanted to build a product that allow people to enter a phone number, any phone number, and be able to locate the phone's true owner. We set out to solve a problem and not to create another app that could be monetized. We believe Zlookup will create more transparency and accountability around mobile and fixed phones and will hold people accountable for their communication related actions. Please share us and spread the word about zlookup if you like us. FAQs How is ZLOOKUP different from other reverse lookup services? We are the only service that offers the most accurate lookup, period. Most other services do not offer lookup at all. They usually keep you waiting on their website while they claim to be \"searching\" information for you - only to come back and ask you to pay them. We are 100% free and our lookup service works! We keep your information completely anonymous to the owner of the phone number you are looking up. We have created this service so anyone can find out who the true owner of the phone number is - safely, securely and anonymously. Zlookup enhances the traditional reverse phone lookup services to provide reliable name coverage for telecom operators who normally do not have Caller ID values available, such as Google Voice or AT&T. While the other reverse lookup services do not support toll-free phone numbers, ZLOOKUP cleverly routes these queries to an expanded dataset so that you get accurate names for toll-free numbers. How does ZLOOKUP make money if reverse cell phone lookup is completely free? Our goal for creating this service is not commercial. We endeavour to create the best resource to create transparency around the phone numbers. Our goal is to limit abuse and giving people access to phone ownership information empowers them to find out who is calling them."
