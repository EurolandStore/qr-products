Each volunteer is trained and supported by highly-qualified staff members all across the country. Select a state to find a local program. Court-appointed special advocate (CASA) and guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteers advocate for the best-interests of children who have experienced abuse or neglect. Volunteers work with child welfare professionals, educators and service providers to ensure that judges have the information they need to make the most well-informed decisions for each child. There are 890 state organizations and local programs in 48 states and the District of Columbia with over 79,000 volunteers nationwide. More volunteers are needed. To join the movement, search the map below and connect with a local program. Once involved, your program will support you every step of the way. The volunteer recruitment campaign is supported by cooperative agreement # 15PJDP-21-GK-02762-CASA awarded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.
