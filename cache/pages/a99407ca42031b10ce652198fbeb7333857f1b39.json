This is because Vercel will create a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, resulting in the inability to detect updates correctly. We recommend that you follow the steps below to re-deploy: - Delete the original repository; - Use the fork button in the upper right corner of the page to fork this project; - Choose and deploy in Vercel again, please see the detailed tutorial. If you encounter a failure of Upstream Sync execution, please manually update code. After forking the project, due to the limitations imposed by GitHub, you need to manually enable Workflows and Upstream Sync Action on the Actions page of the forked project. Once enabled, automatic updates will be scheduled every hour: If you want to update instantly, you can check out the GitHub documentation to learn how to synchronize a forked project with upstream code. You can star or watch this project or follow author to get release notifications in time. This project provides limited access control. Please add an environment variable named CODE on the vercel environment variables page. The value should be passwords separated by comma like this: code1,code2,code3 After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project for the changes to take effect.
