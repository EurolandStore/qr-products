Full Recipe: Ingredients: - 3 medium potatoes - 3 large eggs - 5 slices mozzarella cheese - Fresh parsley, finely chopped (for garnish) - Olive oil (for cooking) - Butter (for greasing) - Salt, to taste - Black pepper, to taste - Paprika, to taste Step-by-Step Preparation: - Prepare the Potatoes: - Wash and peel the potatoes. Slice them into thin rounds, about 1/4 inch thick, for even cooking. - Place the potato slices in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 8-10 minutes until the potatoes are slightly tender but still hold their shape. Drain the water and set the potatoes aside to cool slightly. - Prepare the Baking Dish: - Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). - Grease a medium-sized baking dish with butter or olive oil to prevent sticking. - Layer the Potatoes: - In the greased baking dish, arrange half of the boiled potato slices in an even layer. - Season the layer of potatoes with salt, black pepper, and a sprinkle of paprika for a little extra flavor. - Add the Mozzarella Cheese: - Layer the mozzarella cheese slices evenly over the potatoes. The cheese will melt and create a gooey, cheesy middle layer. - Reserve one or two slices of mozzarella for the top layer if you prefer an extra cheesy crust. - Prepare the Eggs: - In a small bowl, crack the eggs and beat them lightly with a pinch of salt, black pepper, and a dash of paprika. - Pour the beaten eggs evenly over the mozzarella layer. - Add the Remaining Potatoes: - Place the remaining potato slices on top of the eggs and mozzarella. Arrange them neatly to cover the entire surface of the dish. - Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the top layer of potatoes, and season again with salt, black pepper, and paprika. - Bake the Dish: - Place the prepared dish into the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden and crispy on top, and the eggs are set in the middle. - For extra crispiness, you can switch the oven to broil for the last 2-3 minutes of baking. Be sure to watch it closely to prevent burning. - Add Final Cheese Topping (Optional): - If you saved some mozzarella slices, place them on top of the baked dish in the last 5 minutes of baking. Let the cheese melt and turn slightly golden for a cheesy crust. - Serve and Garnish: - Once the bake is ready, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. - Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and fresh flavor. - Slice and serve the cheesy potato and egg bake while it’s still warm. Cooking Tips: - Customize the Dish: Feel free to add additional ingredients to make the dish more filling, such as diced ham, cooked bacon, or sautéed vegetables like spinach or bell peppers. - Cheese Options: While mozzarella provides a mild, creamy taste, you can switch it up with cheddar, gouda, or a blend of your favorite cheeses for a stronger flavor. - Spice It Up: If you enjoy spicier dishes, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper or chili flakes along with the paprika for an extra kick. - Perfect Boiled Potatoes: Be careful not to overcook the potatoes during boiling. You want them to be firm enough to hold their shape when baked, but soft enough to provide a creamy texture inside the bake.
