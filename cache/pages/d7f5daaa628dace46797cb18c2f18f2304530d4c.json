  "text": "Bing Homepage Quiz not working Hello, Is there some secret to getting the Bing Homepage quiz to work correctly? When I try to complete it on the mobile app it just loads the page for the search results for the correct answer and the actual quiz no longer continues. And when I try to complete it on my PC it will say that I have successfully completed the quiz but never award any points. A curiously look through this subreddit seems that a few other people have had similar problems but the only solution I've seen is to complete it on the Xbox app, but unfortunately I do not have an Xbox. I'm just hoping there is some easy fix so that I can get it to start working correctly again."
