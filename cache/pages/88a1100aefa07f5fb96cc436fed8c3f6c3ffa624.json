Solitaire is a card game often known by the name of Klondike. It is one of the most populare individual card games of all time. Deal one face up card to the left of the tableau, then deal six face down cards (from left to right). On top of the face down cards, deal a face up card on the left-most face down pile, and face down cards on the rest until all piles have a face up card. This is a quite challenging variation played with no foundations. The game is finished once there are four complete piles of cards on the tableau. This was invented by reddit user. There are many keys you can use to make your game playing more efficient: - Space - Auto-finish—In foundation games, this moves all the cards it can up to the foundations - z - Undo - x - Redo - n - New Game - g - Replay the same game - f - Flip a card from the stock There is also a card-finder keyboard feature you can use to help you locate cards: - a - Highlight the aces - 1 though 9 - Highlight the cards with the rank pressed - 0 or t - Highlight the tens - d, c, h, s - Highlight the cards with the suit - r, b - Highlight the red or black cards You may combine the rank keys with the suit or color keys. For example, if you hold down the \"5\" key and the \"d\" key then only the 5 of diamonds will be highlighted. \"a\" and \"r\" will highlight the red aces. There are ways to use the mouse to make your game playing more efficient: - Left Click - Move the card to the most logical place (might not be the best move, however) - Left Click in Empty Area - Auto-finish—In foundation games, this moves all the cards it can up to the foundations - Right Click - Undo You can use super moves to make your game playing more efficient. Clicking or dragging a card that isn't immediately accessible will attempt to move all the cards above it in its stack until the move is valid. The effect will be the same as clicking each card. If you cancel the drag or undo the move, all the cards will go back to where they were. Dragging a card or cards to the middle of a stack will attempt to move all the cards above the destination out of the way. The effect is the same as clicking each card. To see where the cards will move, hold the dragged card(s) at the destination for a second. If you decide to move the dragged card(s) somewhere else, just drag them there and the other cards will go back to where they were. Undoing the move will also move the cards back. If you drag a card or cards to the middle of a stack and the cards that move away would be valid to move back on top of the dragged card(s), then they'll slide out of the way and let you just slip the card(s) in."
