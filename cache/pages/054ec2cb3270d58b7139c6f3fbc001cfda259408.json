  "text": "Visit Goshen Eat, Shop, and Enjoy Located approximately 95 miles east of Chicago, Goshen is fast becoming a centre for cultural and visual arts all revolving around a historic downtown which embraces its past. In an area once inhabited by the Miami and Algonquin Indians, Goshen was established in 1831 and is the Elkhart County seat. Visitors can still purchase a “Green River,” take a peek at the police booth built to protect citizens from the dangerous criminal, John Dillinger, visit the Goshen Farmers Market on Saturday mornings, dance in the streets on First Fridays and walk or bike the many paths along the Maple City Greenway and Pumpkinvine Nature trail."
