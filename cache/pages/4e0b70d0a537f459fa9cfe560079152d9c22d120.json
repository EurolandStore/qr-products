  "text": "Change a Child’s Story Your time today can make a difference in a child’s life forever. Our volunteers are part of a community that stands up for children who have been abused and neglected. Court Appointed Special Advocates are community volunteers who are recruited, trained and supervised by professional staff and appointed by family court judges to serve as advocates for children who have been abused or neglected. CASA volunteers make a life-changing difference for New York’s most vulnerable children, many of whom are in foster and kinship care."
