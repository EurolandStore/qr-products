  "title": "Watch: First live performance of ‘Golden’ from KPop Demon Hunters – The Mercury News",
  "text": "Stars from Netflix’s most-watched show “KPop Demon Hunters” sang a full live version of their smash hit “Golden” for the first time on Jimmy Fallon’s “The Tonight Show” Tuesday. EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami are the real singers behind the fictional band Huntr/x and their members Rumi, Mira and Zoey, who are voiced by actors Arden Cho, May Hong, Ji-young Yoo. The animated movie follows the hugely successful K-pop girl band who battle evil forces from the underworld in their spare time. The film has garnered huge success and broke Netflix’s previous most viewed record with 236 million views and counting. On the Tonight Show, the group learned that the soundtrack had gone platinum — in September the song “Golden” led the Top 100 chart for five consecutive weeks. There could be more accolades ahead for the singers as Netflix has submitted “Golden” for consideration in categories at the next Grammy and Academy Awards."
