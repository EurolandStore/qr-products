  "text": "Welcome to Mathematics Stack Exchange We're a little bit different from other sites. Here's how: Ask questions, get answers, no distractions This site is all about getting answers. It's not a discussion forum. There's no chit-chat. Just questions... ...and answers. Good answers are voted up and rise to the top. The best answers show up first so that they are always easy to find. The person who asked can mark one answer as \"accepted\". Accepting doesn't mean it's the best answer, it just means that it worked for the person who asked. Get answers to practical, detailed questions Focus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do. Not all questions work well in our format. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers. Questions that need improvement may be closed until someone fixes them. You earn reputation when people vote on your posts Your reputation score goes up when others vote up your questions, answers, and edits. As you earn reputation, you'll unlock new privileges like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts. At the highest levels, you'll have access to special moderation tools. You'll be able to work alongside our community moderators to keep the site focused and helpful. Improve posts by editing or commenting Our goal is to have the best answers to every question, so if you see questions or answers that can be improved, you can edit them. Use edits to fix mistakes, improve formatting, or clarify the meaning of a post. Use comments to ask for more information or clarify a question or answer. You can always comment on your own questions and answers. Once you earn 50 reputation, you can comment on anybody's post. Remember: we're all here to learn, so be friendly and helpful!
