This website is dedicated to providing you with information about the community and is maintained by the Hillandale Citizens Association, Inc. (HCA) which was established in 1937. Adopt-A-Road HCA has adopted the portion of Powder Mill Road that flows through Hillandale. Please join us for the next scheduled cleanup event on Saturday, February 28th from 9-11AM. Volunteers should gather in the Value Village parking lot adjacent to Powder Mill. We advise that you wear a high-visibility vest or shirt since we will be working along a busy road. Also bring gloves and a grabber if you have one. We’ll supply the trash bags and the laughs! SSL hours can be earned for the students who participate.
