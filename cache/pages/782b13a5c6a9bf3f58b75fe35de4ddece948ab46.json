Learn about our editorial policies hxyume / Getty Images Close Definition EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) is a global standard for secure payment transactions that utilizes chip technology to enhance card security and reduce fraud. What Is EMV? EMV® Chip started as a jointly developed global standard to allow cards with computer chips and terminals used by the largest financial services companies to interact. Today, EMV is a global technology that processes secure payment across face-to-face and remote environments. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa. The standard is now managed by EMVCo, a global technical body that facilitates worldwide interoperability and acceptance of secure payment transactions by managing and evolving the EMV Specifications and related testing processes. Key Takeaways EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, and it enables secure payment processing across face-to-face and remote environments.EMV chip cards require a PIN and generate unique transaction data, improving security over magnetic stripe cards.Although EMV chips reduce fraud in-person, they're less effective at securing online transactions, prompting new standards like EMV 3DS and EMV SRC.Over 94% of global card-present transactions use EMV technology, emphasizing its widespread adoption and impact on payment security.EMV cards with NFC technology allow for secure contactless payments by waving the card over a reader terminal. Investopedia Answers ASK How EMV Technology Secures Payments Point-of-sale (POS) terminals that meet EMV standards typically require the cardholder to use a personal identification number (PIN) instead of a signature, which adds an additional layer of security. EMV cards also contain a circuit chip, which encodes every transaction differently. If a criminal intercepts data from a chip card's transaction, the data cannot be reused to make another purchase. Historically, credit and debit cards only used a magnetic strip to manage cardholder data. The cardholder would then sign a receipt at purchase. This system did not provide a high level of security, as a signature can be forged, and the magnetic strip has proved relatively easy to hack—revealing the cardholder's private information to criminals. In the 1990s, companies began developing chip-based solutions to address the problem of credit card and payment fraud among cardholders. However, the wide variety of technologies used created interoperability problems that were challenging for both consumers and businesses. The result was that less effective magnetic strip technology remained widespread despite the availability of more secure chips. EMVCo’s formation in 1999 provided a set of uniform standards and specifications for using chips in cards and payments, finally allowing this more secure measure to take hold. Designed to reduce fraud in retail settings, the EMV chip and its new set of standards made it nearly impossible to counterfeit a card or fake a transaction. U.S. card issuers did not migrate to EMV Specifications until much later, with issuers setting an initial Oct. 2015 deadline for merchants to shift to the new technology. The prevalence of high-profile data breaches and rising identity theft ultimately motivated U.S. issuers to make the shift to EMV. EMVCo currently has six members: VisaMastercardDiscoverAmerican ExpressChina Union PayJCB Challenges and Limitations of EMV Chip Technology When initially introduced, EMV-equipped chip cards created some confusion and delays for consumers and merchants due to longer transaction times compared to swipe cards and the need to enter a PIN in some marketplaces instead of a signature. However, consumers and merchants soon adapted to chip cards, and since their introduction, card usage has significantly increased worldwide. There are now nearly 13 billion EMV Chip payment cards worldwide, and 94.76% of all card-present transactions conducted globally use EMV Chip technology. While the EMV Chip Specifications reduce the chance of fraud and nullify counterfeit cards for card-present transactions at point-of-sale terminals, they are limited in protecting online transactions. The accelerating growth of e-commerce and online purchases makes this a significant vulnerability that security experts expect will be the focus of credit card fraud going forward. To meet this growing challenge, the EMV® Specifications have now evolved beyond the EMV chip. EMV Specifications for card-not-present payments include EMV 3-D Secure (EMV 3DS), EMV Secure Remote Commerce (EMV SRC), and EMV Payment Tokenisation. Additionally, EMV technology is only as good as the merchant payment processing systems it is used on. Merchants lacking encryption or weak encryption on their POS terminals are leaving payment data vulnerable. EMV® is a registered trademark in the U.S. and other countries and an unregistered trademark elsewhere. The EMV trademark is owned by EMVCo, LLC. Fast Fact EMV card users are increasingly using near-field communication (NFC) technology for contactless payments. Consumers can wave the card over the reader terminal instead of inserting the chip card into a reader. This makes for an even more secure transaction. What Does EMV Stand for? EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, some of the largest payment processors in the world. How Do I Know If My Credit Card Has an EMV Chip? If your card has an EMV chip, you'll see a small chip the size of a fingernail on the front of your card. If yours has fallen off, contact your card issuer to ask for a replacement card so you can use this feature. What Information Is Stored on an EMV Chip? The chip stores a cardholder's account name, account number, and expiration date. It's the same information that's found in the magnetic stripe of the card. The Bottom Line Credit card security has come a long way since the magnetic stripe you used to swipe. To strengthen transaction security around the world, EMVCo's chip cards allow global systems to work together while safeguarding sensitive consumer information.
