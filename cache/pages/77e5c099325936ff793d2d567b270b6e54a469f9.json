This page is built to help you act confidently, claim your bonuses correctly, and enjoy your time playing with security and clarity. How do I create an account and start playing quickly? Signing up is quick: provide your email, choose a password, and enter basic personal details. Accounts are available to players 18 and older, and SpinPals automatically applies the No Deposit Welcome Bonus (30,000 Gold Coins + 3 Sweeps Coins) at signup where permitted. You’ll be asked to confirm your email and may receive prompts to complete verification (KYC) before cash withdrawals. Use MasterCard or Visa for deposits in USD. If a verification request appears, follow the instructions in your account area — uploading ID and proof of address usually resolves things fast. If you run into hurdles, our live chat or support@spinpals.com is available to guide you. What does the Welcome Bonus include and how do I use it? The Welcome Bonus gives you 30,000 Gold Coins plus 3 Sweeps Coins automatically on signup in eligible jurisdictions. Gold Coins are for playing and entertainment only; they cannot be redeemed for cash. Sweeps Coins are redeemable after meeting a 1x playthrough requirement and a minimum redemption of 100 Sweeps Coins. Eligible games include any title on the platform. Daily withdrawal caps and maximum cashout rules apply — general daily cap is $10,000 (Florida and New York have a $5,000 daily cap). If you are located in restricted states (AL, CT, ID, LA, MI, MT, NV, WA), bonuses may not be available. Are there No Deposit Bonus Codes I can use? No codes are required for the auto-applied No Deposit Welcome Bonus: the 30,000 Gold Coins and 3 Sweeps Coins activate automatically upon signup in eligible locations. Occasionally, social media giveaways or mail-in promotions provide extra Sweeps or Gold Coins and those offers will include activation instructions. Always check the terms attached to any promotion for eligibility and redemption rules. What are the First Purchase and other promotional offers? The First Purchase Offer grants 2,300,000 Gold Coins + 23 free Sweeps Coins when you make an eligible purchase (minimum $20). Daily Login Bonuses, Daily Spin Wheel prizes, referrals (100,000 Gold Coins + 10 Sweeps Coins per friend), mail-in bonuses, and social media giveaways provide recurring ways to grow your play balance. Sweeps Coins from these offers require a 1x playthrough before redemption. Bonuses credit automatically when conditions are met; check your account “Get Coins” area for daily claims. Note regional exclusions and daily cashout limits apply. How do deposits and withdrawals work, and what are the limits? Deposits currently accept MasterCard and Visa in USD. Withdrawals of Sweeps Coin redemptions are processed per casino withdrawal procedures and can take up to 5 days to process. Minimum redemption is 100 Sweeps Coins. Maximum redemption per day is $10,000, except Florida and New York where the daily cap is $5,000. Gold Coins are not cashable. Always confirm your account is verified to avoid delays: unverified accounts may experience holds until KYC is completed. Can you explain the wagering requirements in plain terms? Sweeps Coins require a 1x playthrough before you can redeem them for cash. That means you must use the Sweeps Coins in any eligible game(s) until the equivalent value has been wagered once. All games contribute to the 1x requirement. Once the playthrough is met, you can request redemption subject to the minimum redemption amount and daily caps. Gold Coins do not carry wagering-to-cash rules because they are not redeemable for cash. Will SpinPals work on my phone or tablet? Yes. SpinPals is fully compatible with modern mobile browsers on Android and iOS. Games from providers like Pragmatic Play, Evoplay, and Booming Games are optimized for touch controls and dynamic screen sizes. No separate app is required to play most titles — simply log in through your device browser, and your account, bonuses, and saved settings will be available. If you see display issues, clear your browser cache or try a different supported browser; contact live chat if problems persist. Which game providers and titles are available? SpinPals features a broad provider lineup: 3 Oaks, Bgaming (Softswiss), Booming Games, Evoplay, Hacksaw Gaming, KA Gaming, NetGaming, Playson, Pragmatic Play, Rogue, RubyPlay, and Spade Gaming. That mix covers slots, table-style games, and specialty titles so you can chase big payouts, enjoy varied mechanics, and discover new favorites. Eligible games count toward Sweeps Coin playthroughs.

Player protections, transparent bonus rules, and clear payout processes are standard. If you want details about the license authority or recent audits, contact support@spinpals.com via email or live chat for official documentation. What does the verification (KYC) process involve? KYC requests typically ask for a government-issued photo ID and proof of address (a utility bill or bank statement dated within the last three months). Verification helps protect accounts, prevent fraud, and comply with payout rules. Provide clear, legible documents through the secure upload in your account area. Most verifications complete within a few business days; if additional info is needed, support will notify you through your account or email. How does SpinPals handle security and data protection? SpinPals uses standard encryption and secure storage practices to protect account data and transactions. Payment handling is processed through PCI-compliant systems for MasterCard and Visa. Access controls, account verification, and monitoring for suspicious activity help keep funds safe. Never share your password or verification documents by untrusted channels; official communication will come from SpinPals email addresses or the in-site chat. How can I reach customer support if I have a problem? Customer support is available via live chat for instant help and by email at support@spinpals.com for detailed requests.
