Run by SpinPals LLC since 2024, the casino follows clear rules to protect players. Your data is secured with SSL encryption, and all games come from reputable studios that use certified random number generators. Player feedback is largely positive, which supports SpinPalsâ reputation as a safe and trustworthy sweepstakes casino. Why SpinPals Casino Is One of the Best New Online Casinos Launched in 2024, SpinPals has quickly attracted players with strong bonuses and a solid game lineup. New users get a generous welcome package and access to 300+ games, including slots, table games and live dealer titles. The interface is clean, fast and optimized for mobile, so you can play comfortably on any device. Daily rewards and 24/7 customer support add extra value. Combined with high user ratings, these features make SpinPals one of the standout new online casinos for U.S. players. SpinPals Casino Sign Up and Login How to Sign Up at SpinPals Casino Opening an account at SpinPals takes only a few minutes. Click the \"Sign Up\" button on the homepage and complete the form with your email, username and password. Confirm that you are at least 18 years old and accept the Terms and Conditions. After submitting, you may be asked to verify your email or phone with a code. Once verified, your account is active and you can start playing. SpinPals Casino Login Guide To log in, click the \"Login\" button at the top of the site and enter your registered email or username and password. If you forget your password, use the \"Forgot Password\" option to reset it via email. For added security, SpinPals may require a verification code when you access your account from a new device. After logging in, you can go straight to the lobby to view games, bonuses and your balances. Account Verification and Security SpinPals focuses strongly on account security. While registration only needs basic data, you must complete identity verification before your first withdrawal. This usually means uploading a government-issued ID and a recent proof of address so payouts go to the right person. During play, SSL encryption protects your personal and payment details. You can further secure your account with a strong, unique password and by enabling any available two-factor authentication tools in your profile. SpinPals Casino Bonus Offers and Promo Codes Welcome Bonus Package for New Players New players at SpinPals receive a large welcome bonus. After registration and verification, you automatically get 30,000 free Gold Coins and 3 Sweeps Coins without making a deposit. When you buy your first coin package (for example, a $20 purchase), SpinPals adds around 2,300,000 extra Gold Coins and 23 extra Sweeps Coins on top. This welcome offer gives you a big starting bankroll so you can explore more games from day one. For the latest details and multipliers, always check the current promo terms on the site. No Deposit Bonus at SpinPals Casino Every new SpinPals account comes with a no deposit bonus. After you sign up and confirm your email, your balance is credited with 30,000 Gold Coins and 3 Sweeps Coins. Gold Coins are for social, practice-style play, while Sweeps Coins can produce cash winnings. You can try out slots and other casino games immediately without risking your own funds, and only Sweeps Coin winnings can be redeemed for cash after meeting the wagering rules. How to Use a SpinPals Casino Promo Code SpinPals occasionally issues promo codes by email, on social channels or directly on the website. To redeem a code, log in and go to the Cashier or Promotions section. Enter the code in the \"Enter Code\" field and submit it before completing your purchase. If the code is valid, your bonus coins or free spins are credited automatically. Check the terms for each promo code, including expiry dates and any minimum purchase required. Free Spins Bonus on Slots SpinPals regularly runs free spins promotions on selected online slots. These free spins are usually tied to Sweeps Coin play, so any winnings you earn can be withdrawn once you meet the wagering requirement. You can find active free spin offers on the Promotions page or as part of daily login rewards. Free spins are a low-risk way to test new slots and still have a chance to win cashable Sweeps Coin prizes. Reload Bonuses and Ongoing Promotions Existing players can benefit from frequent reload bonuses and recurring offers. SpinPals often boosts subsequent purchases with extra Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins, giving you more playtime with each transaction. There are also daily and weekly promos such as login rewards, prize wheels and seasonal campaigns around major holidays. Check the Promotions tab regularly to see current reload bonuses and limited-time events. Cashback Bonus and Rakeback Deals Instead of classic cashback, SpinPals uses a loyalty-style system. VIP players may receive a small percentage of their net losses back as bonus Sweeps Coins each week. There is also a refer-a-friend program that credits Sweeps Coins when your referrals purchase coins. While these perks are not branded as standard rakeback, they effectively return some value to active players. Always review the bonus rules to understand how and where your bonus coins can be used. Bonus Wagering Requirements and Terms Bonus Sweeps Coins at SpinPals come with wagering requirements. You must place bets with your bonus Sweeps Coins a set number of times before withdrawing any associated winnings. Requirements vary by offer and can be high, so read each promotionâs terms carefully. Gold Coins carry no wagering rules because they are not redeemable. Different game types may contribute differently toward wagering: many slots count fully, while some table games or video poker might count less or be excluded. Knowing these details helps you choose the best games for clearing your bonuses. SpinPals Casino Games Lobby Overview of the Online Casino Lobby The SpinPals casino lobby is clean, structured and simple to browse. After you log in, you can filter by category or use the search bar to locate specific titles. Main sections include Slots, Table Games, Live Casino and Special Games, all reachable from the main menu. Featured and new releases are highlighted so you can quickly see whatâs popular. Games load quickly on both desktop and mobile, and the responsive layout keeps navigation smooth on any screen size. Best Online Slots at SpinPals Casino SpinPals offers a large selection of online slots with different themes, volatility levels and bonus features to suit most playstyles. Classic Slots Classic slots at SpinPals are simple three-reel games inspired by traditional fruit machines. They are ideal for beginners and players who prefer straightforward gameplay. Expect familiar symbols such as fruit, bars and lucky sevens, along with easy rules and low minimum bets. These titles focus on quick spins rather than complex bonus rounds. Video Slots Most of the SpinPals slot library consists of modern video slots with advanced graphics and features. These games often use five or more reels and cover themes like adventure, mythology, horror and fantasy. Common features include free spins rounds, expanding wilds, multipliers and bonus games. Bet sizes range from very low stakes to higher limits, making video slots suitable for casual players and high rollers alike. Jackpot Slots For players seeking large potential payouts, SpinPals features several progressive jackpot slots. In these games, a portion of every qualifying bet feeds a shared jackpot that can grow to impressive amounts. Landing the required symbol combination can deliver a single big prize. These slots typically have higher volatility, so wins are less frequent but can be much larger than on regular games. Table Games: Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat and More Fans of classic casino games will find a strong table game selection at SpinPals. You can choose from multiple versions of roulette, including American, European and French variants, as well as single-hand, multi-hand and VIP blackjack tables. There are also options for baccarat, poker-style games and dice titles. Each table clearly displays its rules and limits, with stakes that work for both beginners and more experienced players. Many low-limit roulette tables start from $1 per spin, while higher-stakes blackjack tables can accept bets into the four figures per hand. Live Casino Games with Real Dealers The live casino at SpinPals brings real-dealer action to your screen via HD video streams. You can join live roulette, blackjack and baccarat tables run by professional dealers in real time. The interface offers a chat box and game statistics so you can follow patterns and interact with the host. Tables run throughout the day, giving you flexible access times. When you play live dealer games with Sweeps Coins, your winnings can be redeemed as real cash once you meet any required wagering conditions. Specialty Games and Instant Win Titles SpinPals also includes a variety of specialty and instant win games. These include scratch cards with instant reveals, hybrid titles that combine reels with fixed multipliers, and arcade-style options such as Crash and Plinko. Gameplay is usually fast and easy to understand, making these games ideal for short sessions. Many of them offer the chance to win Sweeps Coins quickly without the slower pace of table games. Game Providers and Software Quality SpinPals works with a range of respected game providers, including BGaming, Booming Games, Habanero, Hacksaw Gaming, Evoplay and others. These studios are known for visually polished slots and fair game mechanics. As a result, SpinPals delivers stable gameplay with short load times across desktop and mobile devices. Using top-tier software partners also ensures a steady flow of new releases, keeping the casino lobby fresh for regular players. Playing for Real Money at SpinPals Casino How to Play Casino Games Online Playing for real prizes at SpinPals is simple. Log into your account, make sure you have Sweeps Coins available, then pick a game from the lobby and open it in your browser. No download is needed. Set your stake in the game interface and click \"Spin\" on slots or \"Deal\" on card games. Your Sweeps Coin wager is taken from your balance and any win is credited automatically. Gameplay and features are the same on desktop and mobile, so you get a consistent experience across devices. Free Play vs Real Money Play SpinPals separates social play from real-money-style play through two virtual currencies. Gold Coins are used for free play and have no cash value, making them ideal for learning games and trying new strategies without risk. Sweeps Coins are used for real-money-style play and can be earned through purchases and promotions. Bets placed with Sweeps Coins can lead to cashable winnings once you meet redemption rules. You can switch between Gold Coin and Sweeps Coin modes depending on whether you want practice or real prize potential. Minimum and Maximum Bets Bet limits at SpinPals depend on the game. Many slot machines allow very low stakes, sometimes starting at $0.01 per spin, which is useful for smaller budgets. Low-limit roulette and blackjack tables usually begin at $1 per bet, while high-limit games and VIP tables accept much larger wagers. Some high-roller slots allow spins of $100 or more, and premium blackjack tables can support bets in the thousands per hand. Keep in mind that the maximum daily coin purchase is capped at $20, so higher-stakes play may require planning your purchases over time. SpinPals Casino Payments: Deposit, Withdrawal and Payout Speed How to Make a Deposit Depositing at SpinPals is straightforward. After logging in, go to the Cashier section and choose your payment option: Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Apple Pay. Enter the amount you want to deposit (between $1 and $20 per transaction), add your payment details and confirm. Deposits are processed instantly, and your Gold Coin and Sweeps Coin balances update right away so you can start playing. Deposit Methods Withdrawal Methods and Payout Times SpinPals processes Sweeps Coin redemptions via bank transfer (ACH). To withdraw, open the Cashier, choose the withdrawal option and enter your bank details. The minimum withdrawal is 100 Sweeps Coins (about $1), and the maximum per request is around $10,000. Once your request is approved, bank transfers usually reach your account within 3â5 business days, although times can vary by bank and verification status. Withdrawal Methods Using Crypto at SpinPals Casino SpinPals currently supports only traditional payment methods in U.S. dollars. Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are not available. If you hold digital currencies, you must first convert them to USD with a third-party service and then fund your SpinPals account using a supported card or Apple Pay. Until crypto options are added, all official transactions on the site remain in fiat currency. Fees, Limits and Processing Times SpinPals does not add extra fees to deposits or withdrawals, though your bank or card issuer may charge its own costs. Deposits run from $1 to $20 per transaction, and overall purchase caps may apply within a given period. Withdrawal limits start at 100 Sweeps Coins and go up to around $10,000 per request. Approved withdrawals generally take 3â5 business days to arrive. Completing KYC verification before asking for a payout can help avoid hold-ups. Verification Requirements for Fast Payout For the fastest payouts, SpinPals recommends verifying your account as early as possible. You can upload a valid government ID and proof of address through the secure account area. Once your documents are approved, future withdrawals usually process more smoothly. If you request a withdrawal without prior verification, the casino may pause the transaction until your identity is confirmed. Verifying early is the best way to ensure quick access to your winnings. SpinPals Casino Mobile App and Mobile Play SpinPals Mobile Casino for Android and iOS SpinPals Casino runs directly in mobile browsers on Android and iOS devices. There is no native app, so you simply visit the website from Chrome, Safari or another browser. The responsive design adjusts to your phone or tablet, allowing you to browse games, manage your account and claim bonuses with ease. Controls are touch-friendly, and performance is smooth as long as you have a stable internet connection. SpinPals Casino APK Download for Android There is no official SpinPals APK for Android. Any third-party application that claims to be a SpinPals app should be treated as unsafe. Android players should access the casino only through a web browser and can use the \"Add to Home Screen\" feature to create a quick-launch icon.

All core features, including promotions, loyalty rewards, deposits and live chat support, work in the mobile browser. You get the complete SpinPals experience on the go without needing a dedicated app. SpinPals Casino Countries and Availability Who Can Play at SpinPals Casino SpinPals is targeted mainly at players in the United States and Canada.

To join, you must register with a valid address in an eligible jurisdiction and confirm that you are at least 18 years old. Players from other countries should check the siteâs terms and conditions to confirm local eligibility. Languages and Currencies Available The SpinPals platform currently supports English only. Instead of traditional currency balances, it uses Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins as virtual credits. Players purchase coin packages with U.S. dollars using accepted payment methods, then use those coins to play games. Cash redemptions are processed in USD, and there is no built-in support for localizing balances into other real-world currencies.

Restricted U.S. states include Alabama, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Arizona and Washington. Residents of these states cannot create an account or play. Most other U.S. states and many Canadian provinces are allowed. For users outside North America, acceptance depends on local regulations. If your area is restricted, the website will prevent registration and real play. SpinPals Casino Security, Fair Play and Responsible Gambling Licensed and Regulated Online Casino SpinPals operates under the U.S. sweepstakes model rather than a conventional online gambling license. While it does not hold a Curacao or MGA license, it complies with sweepstakes regulations and disclosure rules. The operator uses SSL encryption to safeguard user data and applies standard checks to prevent underage accounts and fraud.

RNG Testing and Fair Games All digital games at SpinPals rely on random number generator technology to produce fair results. Since the content is supplied by major studios, game outcomes are tested against industry standards to ensure randomness. Slots and table games are designed to match their advertised return-to-player (RTP) rates over the long term. This setup means that every spin, card draw or dice roll is independent and cannot be influenced by the casino. Responsible Gambling Tools and Limits SpinPals promotes responsible gambling through built-in tools and clear guidance. Players can set deposit limits and enable session reminders from their account settings to manage time and spending. Optional reality checks can prompt you to take breaks. If you feel your gaming is becoming excessive, you are encouraged to reduce your limits or pause play. Even though the platform uses virtual coins, SpinPals reminds users to spend only what they are comfortable losing.

By contacting customer support, you can request a temporary or permanent block on your account. During self-exclusion you cannot log in, play games or receive promotional offers.
