  "text": "OK, so I am trying to convince my Wife that a wood stove is a good idea. I grew-up around wood stoves, my Wife grew-up with a non-smelly heat pump. The latest road block on my way to burning wood in the house is that my Wife is afraid that the whole house will smell like wood smoke - everything, clothes, clothes in the closet, funiture, carpet, the dog, etc., and if she ain't happy, nobody is happy! Will a nice modern wood stove smell-up the house? When we get dressed and go out for dinner, will the waiter say, \"You guys smell like wood smoke.\" Thanks!
