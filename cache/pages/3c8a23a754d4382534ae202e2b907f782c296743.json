Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Thank you so much for considering to support me!There are currently two ways to support me:1) By downloading my Mods the official Mod Hub App by CurseForge to install my Mods & auto update them, or the Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev, which is free for you! 2) By becoming my Patron via Patreon. Manual Installation:Click on one of the Download Buttons to download my Mods either via CurseForge or Google Drive. Open the downloaded Zip File with Winzip, Winrar or similiar and drag & drop the *.package File into your Sims 4 Mods Folder (Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods). If a Mod has Optional Addons, install them the same Way if you want them.Script Mods (contain *.ts4script Files with or without *.package files)Click on one of the Download Buttons to download my Mods either via CurseForge or Google Drive. Open the downloaded Zip File with Winzip, Winrar or similiar and drag & drop the *.package File(s) & *.ts4script File into your Sims 4 Mods Folder (not more than one Subfolder deep for example Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods > LittleMsSam). Donât rename any of those or it might not work. Enable Script Mods via Game Options > Other.XML InjectorA lot of my Mods don't have a Script File anymore, or have been improved (e.g. loading times) to support the XML Injector Mod.Download the XML Injector via scumbumbomods.comAutomatic Installation via Apps:You can use the official Mod Hub App by CurseForge to install my Mods & auto update them, or the Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev. If a Mod is not working (for example Interactions donât show up ingame) do the following Steps:1) Check the Installation Guide above if you have missed an important Installation Step. Most common Error is the Installation of Script mods too deep into the Mods Folder or Script Mods is not enabled in the Game Options! Be aware after each Patch check these Options because they can get disabled by the Patch.2) Youâve got an old version of the Mod maybe? After each Game Patch, check on my main page to see if any of my Mods needed an Update. Iâll mention only the Mods that needed to be updated, if it wasnât mentioned it doesnât need an Update. If a Mod did got updated, delete the older files from your Mods folder, and re-download the updated version.3) Check for Mod Conflicts! To do that move all other Mods and CC out of the Mod Folder into a Backup Folder on your Desktop. Delete the localthumbcache.package in your Sims 4 Folder. Start the Game and check if you still have the Issue even if just this one Mod is in your Mod Folder. DONâT click on Save or else all your saved CC etc will be gone! Just close your Game without saving.If the Mod works without any other Mod/CC you know there is either a Mod Conflict or another Mod that is causing an Issue which is influencing my Mod. Now the only way to find out which one it is, is to 50/50 all your Mods. (How to 50/50 post by EG)If the Mod still not works i invite you to contact me via the Support Channel on Discord so we can try to figure out what the problem is.If a Mod is causing an Error (lastException.txt in your Sims 4 Folder):1) Check for Mod Conflict!

Join my Discord https://discord.gg/KpZsvRM Are your Mods updated for the latest Patch?The general answer is, yes. I usually check my Mods the same Day a Patch got released, and if some Mods needed an Update they get updated the same Day as well. It happens very rarely that i need more days, e.g. when a huge Patch got released, which broke 50% of my Mods. Do you do Mod commissions?No, i don't. My Number One Rule is, to only make Mods i need in my own Game. I am open for Ideas, but there is no guarantee that i will do a suggested Mod.Do you have a Patreon, or another Option to donate?No, i don't but thank you for asking. If you want to show your gratitude, you can do so by downloading my Mods via CurseForge or the Sims 4 Mod Manager.
