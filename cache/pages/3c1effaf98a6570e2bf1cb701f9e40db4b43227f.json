  "text": "Beer, Wine Fests Celebrate the Craft in June It’s going to be a party on the farm in Baileys Harbor this Saturday, June 14, when the Door County Beer Festival pops the top on the 12th edition of the festival at About Thyme Farm. The event features live music from Open Tab to fill the grounds while beer aficionados sample from nearly 200 craft beers from Wisconsin and the Midwest. Attendees get a commemorative tasting glass and unlimited tastings from noon to 4 pm from 45 breweries and two home brew clubs scattered across the grounds and barns of the farm on County Road F. Organizers have arranged a free shuttle service to get people safely to and from the grounds – there is no parking at the farm. Shuttles will pick up revelers in Sister Bay, Egg Harbor, Fish Creek, Baileys Harbor and Ephraim. There is a park-and-ride location at the Baileys Harbor Rec Park on Summit Road as well. The Beer Festival is the first of two big events at the farm this June. On June 21, the Door County Wine Fest takes place at the farm, featuring more than 80 wines from the 10 wineries of the Door County Wine Trail. Wine Fest will feature unlimited tastings from Door Peninsula, Anchored Roots, Harbor Ridge, Mixed Meadia, Lautenbach’s Orchard Country, Lake Fire, Stone’s Throw, Simon Creek, Von Stiehl and Door 44 wineries. Meet the people behind the labels, explore the flavors of one of the most diverse wine regions in the world, and pair it all with cheese from Hoard’s Dairyman Farm Creamery as you enjoy live music and taste the wares of local food trucks on the grounds.
