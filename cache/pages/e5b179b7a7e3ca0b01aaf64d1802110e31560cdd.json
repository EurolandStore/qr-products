The sooki are prepared by first boiling to remove excess fat, then stewing in a mixture of Aamui(Japanese:awamori, to soften the meat), soy sauce, and sugar for three to four hours. They are then placed in a bowl of Suba. sooki jiru [edit]Soup containing sooki, konbu (edible seaweed), and daikon (Japanese radish), with salt and soy sauce for flavoring. The sooki are first boiled to remove excess fat and drippings, then stewed in the soup until tender. In Japan, konbu is usually used just for flavoring and then discarded[dubious – discuss], but a distinctive feature of Okinawan soups is that the konbu is left in.
