Read on to learn how to get any Shiny easily by farming Mass Outbreaks, how to hunt for Shiny Pokemon in the wild, and the best odds for finding Shinies in Pokemon Legends: Arceus (PLA). List of Contents The old shiny hunting method no longer works after updating the game to version 1.1.0. This method will still work, however, if you have not updated your game yet! Massive Mass Outbreaks present a new method to hunt shiny Pokemon. This requires you to complete Request 95: A New Anomaly. which was added in the new Daybreak Content from Update 1.1.0. Daybreak and Ver. 1.1.0 Update Note: Disabling Autosave is recommended. Massive Mass Outbreaks are time limited and will end once the weather peters out. Make sure to plan out routes so you can quickly run or fly to another outbreak to maximize the chances of getting shiny. Prioritize outbreaks that are very close to one another so that you can quickly move to another outbreak spot without having to travel too far. It's also a good idea to unlock all the base camps to easily fast travel between locations. Most outbreaks are littered across the map but a few spawn very close to base camps. These are especially useful when outbreaks appear in the Cobalt Coastlands and Coronet Highlands where traversing the map manually is especially tricky. All Base Camps and How to Unlock Special Massive Mass Outbreaks are marked with a star on the map and will spawn a second outbreak once cleared. All Pokemon spawned in the second outbreak are the Pokemon's immediate evolution and has an additional chance to spawn as Alpha Pokemon. Catching Pokemon from these spots is very efficient as it gives you a second chance to catch a shiny as well as a shiny Alpha Pokemon when they spawn. Best Shiny Alpha Pokemon Hunting Routes If there isn't a shiny Pokemon when you first approach the outbreak, don't reset just yet! Pokemon will respawn within their outbreak a few at a time (up to about 14-15 Pokemon). To get new Pokemon to spawn, force the non-shinies to leave the outbreak by: To clear out the non-shiny Pokemon as efficiently as possible, use a Stealth Spray just before approaching the Mass Outbreak, then snipe the Pokemon with Feather Balls. Most massive mass outbreaks are located far from tall grass and special outbreaks spawn evolutions of the original Pokemon that will often attack you. With a healthy stock of Sticky Globs, you can easily catch aggressive Pokemon even when they are out in the open. Simply evade their attack, stun them with the Sticky Glob, and back strike them with a Pokeball while they're stunned. Pokemon have a Base Shiny Rate of 1/4096, and its shiny rate is further affect by four different factors that increase the chances of finding a shiny. Three of these are tied to Pokedex Completion, with the last one related to Mass Outbreaks and Massive Mass Outbreaks. The optimal rates for Shiny Pokemon require the Shiny Charm and all research tasks for that Pokemon completed for a Perfect page, and encounter the Pokemon through as Mass Outbreak. The Shiny Charm can be obtained once all Pokemon pages have achieved Research Level 10. Raise your Research Level for every Pokemon to get the Shiny Charm. How to Get Research Points Fast While Mass Outbreaks have a higher shiny rate than Massive Mass Outbreaks, they are generally more reliable for hunting shiny Pokemon. Special Mass Outbreaks will cause a Mass Outbreak to spawn right after clearing the Mass Outbreak before it. The second spawn will also be the previous Pokemon's evolution at a higher level, and also has a chance to spawn as an outbreak of Alpha Pokemon. The possibility of a second mass outbreak spawn in the same location makes shiny hunting more efficient, and it also makes hunting for Shiny Alpha Pokemon easier compared to waiting for them to spawn in their static encounters. Best Shiny Alpha Pokemon Hunting Routes Shiny Pokemon are an extremely rare variation of Pokemon which can randomly appear when encountering Pokemon in the wild. By default, each Pokemon encountered has is a 1/4096 chance to be a Shiny Pokemon. One way to tell if the Pokemon is Shiny is by the sound they make when they spawn. Shiny Pokemon make a distinct sound whenever they spawn in the map. On the rarest of occasions, Shiny Pokemon may appear in the wild while you are exploring the Hisui region. Be on the lookout for Pokemon with different colors and keep an ear out if a distinct sound is played. If you save the game with a Shiny Pokemon in sight, the Pokemon will remain even after resetting the game. This is very useful in cases where the Shiny Pokemon needs to be battled for you to capture it, as you can simply reload the game if you accidentally knock it out. You can also disable the autosave function so that your progress is not saved if the Shiny Pokemon fainted. How to Save the Game: Is Autosave Available? Unfortunately, all Pokemon found through static encounters are shiny-locked, meaning they are unable to be shiny. This applies to the starter you choose from Professor Laventon at the start of the game, as well as most legendaries. Are Starters and Legendaries Shiny Locked?
