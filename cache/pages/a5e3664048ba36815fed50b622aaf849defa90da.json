  "text": "Art Nouveau architecture on Alberta Street in RÄ«ga. Diego Grandi/Shutterstock Latviaâs capital can cast a spell on even the most experienced travelers. Itâs a city where medieval mysteries live alongside contemporary art performances, hundreds of Art Nouveau buildings line historic streets, and the cityâs flourishing culinary scene offers traditional Latvian dishes and modern Nordic cuisine. Yet, RÄ«ga is largely undiscovered by mass tourism. Itâs perfect for appreciating a tranquil and cultural city without a crowd. Whether you prefer experiencing warm summer nights or fresh winter mornings, walking around art galleries or spending time in nature, going to local alternative bars or extravagant concert halls, RÄ«ga offers it all. When should I go to RÄ«ga? The best time for visiting RÄ«ga is summer, when everything is green, the days are long and warm, and there is plenty of sunshine. In the middle of June, the sun rises as early as 4:30am and sets as late as 10:20pm. What could be better than sipping a sparkling drink on a terrace or listening to live music late in the evening while it is still pleasant and light outside? Summertime in RÄ«ga comes with many open-air concerts and other cultural events, most of which are free to attend. RÄ«gaâs cultural life peaks in August, when the city celebrates its anniversary offering a wide range of events. With the average temperature around 20ÂºC to 25ÂºC (68ÂºF to 77ÂºF) and only rarely reaching 32ÂºC (90ÂºF), RÄ«ga is an excellent summer destination for escaping the heatwaves of Europe's southern countries. If you are not afraid of cooler weather, a lack of sunlight and possibly heavy rainfall, then other seasons work just as well. Late spring comes with wonderful blossoms in the parks and green spaces of RÄ«ga. Early autumn paints the whole city golden. The middle of winter might surprise you with a marvelous Christmas atmosphere: lovely craft markets, aromatic mulled wine and white snowflakes falling from the pitch-black sky. Avoid visiting RÄ«ga in November or February, which are usually the dreariest months of the year. How much time should I spend in RÄ«ga? If you spend only a weekend in RÄ«ga, you can probably see the most important sites. You can walk around the charming cobblestone streets of the VecrÄ«ga (Old Town), where a rich variety of architectural styles from Gothic to Modern stand side by side. Visit picturesque sites such as the House of the Blackheads, St. Peterâs Church, RÄ«ga Dome Cathedral, Three Brothers, and the Great Guild (closed for reconstruction until 2026); walk along the canal; go to the Freedom Monument and the magnificent Latvian National Opera and Ballet building. Leave some time for exploring the famous Art Nouveau district around Alberta Street â â a place likely to leave you speechless. Visit some of RÄ«gaâs finest museums, such as the Latvian National Museum of Art, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia and the Zuzeum Art Center. Adding a couple more days will allow you to enjoy the city at a slower pace and go to lesser-known places and suburbs. Cross the Daugava River and spend a day walking around Ägenskalns. Once a poor district inhabited by fishermen, sailors and workers, it is now an enchanting area with its specific appeal loved by creative souls and hipsters and includes a notable example of wooden architecture and Art Nouveau buildings. Take a tram to MeÅ¾aparks and relax in one of the greenest areas of RÄ«ga â breathe in some fresh air in the pine woods, have lunch by the Lake Ä¶Ä«Å¡ezers and admire countless villas from the 20th century. You can even go to the seaside and spend a day on the beach without leaving the city. But if you do want to reveal a bit more of Latvia, there are many great day-trip destinations you can easily reach from RÄ«ga, such as Sigulda, CÄsis and JÅ«rmala. Is it easy to get in and around RÄ«ga? RÄ«ga Airport is the largest airport in the Baltic states, which makes it a popular place to fly into whether you are just visiting Latvia or heading on to Lithuania or Estonia. After arriving at RÄ«ga Airport, look for the city bus No. 22 which offers cheap and easy transportation to the city center (30 minutes). Alternatively, you might choose the Lux Express shuttle bus, hire a taxi or use the Bolt car-sharing service and drive to the city center yourself. If you want to reach the city from other European cities, look for long-distance bus offers by companies such as Lux Express, Ecolines and FlixBus, which connect RÄ«ga to cities as far away as Amsterdam. The most popular connections are between RÄ«ga and Warsaw (13 hours), Vilnius (4 hours), Tallinn (4 hours and 30 minutes) and Tartu (4 hours). You can also combine taking a ferry from Helsinki to Tallinn (2 hours) and continuing your way to RÄ«ga by bus. RÄ«ga is an ideal city for those who favor walking around on foot â it is flat and walkable and offers beautiful architectural details that make any walk a memorable sightseeing activity. Most of the tourist attractions are located in the central part of the city, so if you are staying in RÄ«ga for just a couple of days you may not even need to think about using any transport. If you are visiting RÄ«ga for a longer time, you can take a bus, trolley bus or tram to escape the main tourist routes, explore the suburbs, relish the seaside or even go for a hike in nature. You can buy tickets and check out timetables and routes on the Mobilly app or RÄ«gas satiksme website. Top things to do in RÄ«ga See RÄ«ga from different angles RÄ«ga features such diverse architecture that it is worth experiencing it from different perspectives. After walking around the Old Town and popular Art Noveau streets on foot, choose one of the viewing platforms â Latvian Academy of Sciences, St Peterâs Church or RÄ«ga Doma Church â to observe the city from a birdâs-eye view. If you feel adventurous enough, rent a kayak and explore a completely new angle of the city from the canal and the Daugava River. The most popular panorama of RÄ«ga with its church towers trying to reach the sky can be seen from the AB Dam or the National Library of Latvia. Sample Latvian cuisine in beautiful markets RÄ«ga is known for its amazing markets, full of fresh vegetables, dairy products, meat and fish. The most famous is RÄ«ga Central Market, one of the largest markets in Europe. Dive into the aisles of the market and go on a culinary journey! Make sure you try out rupjmaize (rye bread), biezpiens (cottage cheese), smoked fish, pickled vegetables, JÄÅu siers (a type of cheese), kvass (fermented bread-based beverage) and anything else that attracts your attention. If you find yourself wandering around Ägenskalns, stop by its recently renovated market that has become a real cultural hub and a discovery for culinary tourists. Embrace the local music scene in RÄ«ga You cannot say you have been to RÄ«ga if you have not immersed yourself in its cultural scene. Classical music enthusiasts will appreciate the program of Latvian National Opera and Ballet. Those who prefer alternative music will love hearing unknown musicians performing at bars like Aleponija or Atmoda and throughout the Tallin Street Quarter. And jazz fans will be amazed by the atmosphere of M/DarbnÄ«ca. Explore the different departments of the Latvian National Museum of Art, and go outside the city center to visit the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia or SongSpace, dedicated to the unique tradition of the Song and Dance Festival. My favorite thing to do in RÄ«ga I love a lot of things about RÄ«ga, but most of all I enjoy wandering around the city center and spotting interesting architectural details. When it comes to discovering Art Nouveau, most tourists think it is enough to visit Alberta Street or Elizabetes Street. But the whole city center is full of wonderful examples of this architectural style waiting to be admired. Almost every building has its style, character and special vibe. Even after seeing the same buildings countless times, I can still find new details on their facades. TÄrbatas, KriÅ¡jÄÅa Barona, Aleksandra Äaka and BrÄ«vÄ«bas Streets are the ones you might start with. Some of my favorite examples can be found at 33/35 TÄrbatas, 58 BrÄ«vÄ«bas and 26 Aleksandra Äaka. Lift your eyes, get your camera out and be ready to be surprised by what you will see. When I get tired of the hustle and bustle of the streets, I go and relax at ZiedoÅdÄrzs, one of the nicest parks in RÄ«ga. How much money do I need for RÄ«ga?
