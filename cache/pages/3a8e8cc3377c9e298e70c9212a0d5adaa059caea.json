I can and will verify that we make knives because, unlike those who frequented this forum 13 years ago, I not only saw but partook in the making of said knives and continue to do so today. I have photographic evidence on our website www.jacobscustomknives.com and our Facebook and Instragram pages @Jacobscustomknives. I would gladly invite anyone who disbelieves me to come to my shop in Texas where I will prove we do make our D2 knives from scratch from a blank bar of steel."
