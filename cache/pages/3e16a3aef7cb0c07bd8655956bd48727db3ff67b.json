  "text": "Username: Chouhdry Been a member on Fresh since 2012, in 2016 I went off for a few months and came back on, all my the rares including the ones I paid for went and my rooms were wiped however the rooms were there just empty. I can't get my rares back already spoken to staff about that however there should be a way you can restore all my rooms, I am a loyal Fresh User in my opinion as I have invested Â£328.40 in Fresh and thinking to invest more. Could you please help restore my rooms as some took very long and were hard to make. Thanks, Chouhdry"
