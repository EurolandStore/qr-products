  "text": "The Andy Griffith Museum provides a permanent place for the world’s largest collection of Andy Griffith memorabilia. Located next to the Andy Griffith Playhouse and a half-mile from Andy’s boyhood home, the museum houses items collected by childhood friend Emmett Forrest. The museum includes iconic signs from the show’s courthouse doors that read: “Sheriff” and “Justice of the Peace.” There are also mementos from Don Knotts who played Deputy Barney Fife, actress Betty Lynn who plated Thelma Lou and George Lindsey who played Goober."
