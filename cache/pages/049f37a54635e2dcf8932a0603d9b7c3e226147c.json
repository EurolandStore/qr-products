  "text": "Your perfect paper is only a few steps away PERRLA creates and sets up your paper automatically for you so you’re ready to start writing. You’ll never have to set up the paper’s margins, running head, headers, page numbers, or text formatting again! You can create every single APA, MLA & Turabian Reference type with PERRLA’s human-built, human-tested proprietary Reference Engine. PERRLA saves your references to re-use them in future papers – save time on references twice. Place your cursor where you want a citation and PERRLA handles the rest. We follow all the (obscure) rules, so you can cite your research and move on with your paper. PERRLA also creates tables, figures, abstracts, tables of content, appendices & heading levels too. You always end up with a normal Word document with PERRLA – ready to turn in, submit for review, or print (the old school way)."
