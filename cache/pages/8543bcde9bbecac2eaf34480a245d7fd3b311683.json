I live in Rocklin so I would be going to the Roseville facilities. So which give better health care overall, Sutter Roseville or Kaiser Roseville? 01-17-2010, 11:46 PM Location: Sacramento, Placerville 2,509 posts, read 6,652,011 times Reputation: 2267 You will probably be happier with Sutter. 01-18-2010, 11:57 AM 28,168 posts, read 66,509,476 times Reputation: 23424 I realize the question is better Health Care... but, I also think the general attitude of employees makes a difference... I work in Health Care... not for Sutter or Kaiser. Have lots of colleagues working at Sutter oe Kaiser... right now, Kaiser is the hands down favorite... Sutter has had lots of dissatisfied Nurses and there have been several strikes at both Sutter Facilities in my area over closing facilities... All those I know that went to Kaiser are glad they did... 01-18-2010, 02:18 PM Location: SW MO 23,589 posts, read 39,541,387 times Reputation: 29364 Quote: Originally Posted by fairytalelover I'm starting a new job and was wondering which insurance to pick.

One of the benefits of Kaiser is that it's one-stop shopping. Everything is under one roof and they don't spare the wellness services, pharmacy, lab, x-ray, etc. Kaiser is one of the things we miss most, having moved to a state they don 't serve. 01-18-2010, 02:48 PM Location: Sacramento, Placerville 2,509 posts, read 6,652,011 times Reputation: 2267 Sutter has everything under one roof out in Roseville. If you are in Sacramento you will find everything in Midtown Sacramento within the same distance that you would walking through one of Kaiser's hospitals. As for favorites, I haven't seen any real surveys published. I've only heard of opinions by fans of Kaiser. I've heard plenty of opinions from people who don't like Kaiser. If you prefer the traditional kind of doctor's offices, go with Sutter. Some people don't like the huge waiting rooms full of people at Kaiser, and that is the way I feel about it. It is almost like waiting among a herd of cattle. But then, some people like it. UD, Davis Medical is excellent too. I don't know if they have anything out in Roseville though. 01-18-2010, 06:24 PM 1,985 posts, read 5,558,466 times Reputation: 2472 Quote: Originally Posted by fairytalelover I'm starting a new job and was wondering which insurance to pick. I live in Rocklin so I would be going to the Roseville facilities. So which give better health care overall, Sutter Roseville or Kaiser Roseville? Personally, it would be unprofessional for me to offer negative comments about Kaiser. The other posters are free to share their experiences on this issue. However, I have served as a consultant to the Sutter Transitional and Respiratory Unit at Sutter Roseville for several years and would offer the following observations: The staff on the STARS unit takes care of the most complex and medically challenging patients imaginable. These patients require long-term maintenance on ventilators as a result of anoxic encephalopathy or may be comatose secondary to head and neck trauma. I have found the Pulmonologists dedicated, competent, and responsive to consulting recommendations. They are assisted by an experienced and caring Nurse Practitioner. The team of CNAs and Nurses are thorough, knowledgeable, and are tireless in their efforts to comfort the patients. In addition, other hospital departments such as Radiology, Respiratory therapy, and Pharmacy work closely with the STARS staff as a team to provide the expertise these patients require. Finally, I also have to compliment Nursing Management ( and this is saying something since I am reputed to have \"authority issues\" and am not usually respectful of management ). Both the Director of Nursing for the unit and her assistant place clinical goals ahead of financial or political pressures. They are relentless in their advocacy of what is best for the patient. In summary,in choosing your insurance there are a myriad of factors to consider. However, from my experience, the quality of care at Sutter Roseville is excellent. I hope an inpatient stay is not in your future, and I particularly pray you never need the services of the STARS unit, but if you do, you couldn't be in better hands. 01-18-2010, 07:54 PM 49 posts, read 200,924 times Reputation: 22 Since we are talking about heathcare--Does any one do cardiac ultrasound??
