JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), is a universal file format that utilizes an algorithm to compress photographs and graphics. The considerable compression that JPG offers is the reason for its wide use. As such, the relatively small size of JPG files makes them excellent for transporting over the Internet and using on websites. You can use our compress JPEG tool to reduce the file size by up to 80%! If you need even better compression, you can convert JPG to WebP, which is a newer and more compressible file format. Almost all image-viewer programs and applications recognize and can open JPG files. Simply double-clicking the JPG file will usually result in its opening in your default image viewer, image editor, or web browser. To select a specific application to open the file, utilize right-click, and select \"Open with\" to make your selection. JPG files open automatically on popular web browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Photos, and Mac OS applications such as Apple Preview. To resize JPEG images use our Image Resizer tool. Developed by: Joint Photographic Experts Group Initial Release: 18 September 1992 Related JPG Tools: Use our Color Picker to pick colors from images The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a universal file format that comprises characteristics of both text documents and graphic images which makes it one of the most commonly used file types today. The reason PDF is so widely popular is that it can preserve original document formatting. PDF files always look identical on any device or operating system. Most people head right to Adobe Acrobat Reader when they need to open a PDF. Adobe created the PDF standard and its program is certainly the most popular free PDF reader out there. It's completely fine to use, but I find it to be a somewhat bloated program with lots of features that you may never need or want to use. Most web browsers, like both Chrome and Firefox, can open PDFs themselves. You may or may not need an add-on or extension to do it, but it's pretty handy to have one open automatically when you click a PDF link online. I highly recommend SumatraPDF or MuPDF if you're after something a bit more. Both are free.
