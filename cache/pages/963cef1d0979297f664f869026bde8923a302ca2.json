Hey y'all, I've been wanting to change things up this year and make a really really nice turkey, and I've heard some people use Kerrygold to butter the turkey instead of generic regular stick butter. Have any of you tried it as opposed to generic butter and is it worth the price? I'd even consider using it in mashed potatoes. Thanks!"
