  "text": "Property Master Plans Completed Plans A property master plan establishes the level and type of public uses permitted, details the authorized resource management and the facility development, and acts as a blueprint for the property, providing for consistent, long-term management, regardless of personnel changes. Plan amendments and variances are considered part of an approved plan. Plan amendments and variances authorize changes to the originally approved plan, add clarity and/or include elements not originally addressed in the plan."
