  "text": "F.A.Q's At Karnis Hummus and More we believe in honesty and transparency. So we are here to answer all your question, feel free to contact us if you need more info… Yes, we believe that everyone deserves to enjoy our delicious salads and dips therefore we are certified by OK Kosher Certification, one of the major kosher certification agencies. Look for the Logo. Our Salads, Dips and Aiolis are Gluten Free, however we are yet to be Gluten-Free certified. Our salads and dips have a 95 days shelf-life with all natural preservatives! It is possible, however, it is best to consume Karnis’ products fresh. Falafel is a chickpea based Mediterranean dish, which is served best with hummus, Tahini and freshly cut Israeli salad. Our products are made from fresh at our Opa-Locka, FL factory. Our Shakshuka Sauce is made with freshly picked tomatoes, Jalapeno peppers, Bell peppers and garlic. Just heat it up with some Olive oil, add an egg and sprinkle it with parsley. Most of our products are based on family recipes therefore it only made sense that the company will be named after the owner’s last name – Neal Karni. Our Hummus, Tahini, Matbucha, Turkish salad, Spanish Eggplant and Shakshuka sauce are vegan, however, our Babaganoush and Vegetarian Chopped Liver contain eggs. We’re yet to receive a Vegetarian certification."
