Eating eggs as part of an overall nutrient-rich eating plan can support your overall health, including your cardiovascular system and eyes. Keep reading to learn the health benefits of eating eggs. Eggs are among the most nutritious foods on the planet. A whole egg contains all the nutrients required to turn a single cell into a baby chicken. A single large boiled egg - Vitamin A: 8% of the DV (daily value) - Folate: 6% of the DV - Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5): 14% of the DV - Vitamin B12: 23% of the DV - Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 20% of the DV - Phosphorus: 7% of the DV - Selenium: 28% of the DV - Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, calcium and zinc This comes with 78 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat. Eggs also contain various trace nutrients that are important for health. In fact, eggs are pretty much the perfect food. They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient you need. If you can get your hands on pastured or omega-3-enriched eggs, these are even more nutrient-dense. They contain higher amounts of omega-3 fat and are much higher in vitamins A and E. Eggs are high in cholesterol, with a single egg containing However, cholesterol in the diet may not necessarily impact blood cholesterol levels or your risk of heart disease in all people, though research is still mixed. The liver produces large amounts of cholesterol every single day. Your liver has the ability to regulate cholesterol levels by producing less to even it out. The response to eating eggs can vary between individuals. In some people, eating cholesterol may not raise blood cholesterol or only mildly raise it. In the others, eggs or other sources of dietary cholesterol may lead to a large rise in blood cholesterol. However, people with genetic disorders like familial hypercholesterolemia or carriers of a gene variant called APOE4 may want to consider eating eggs in moderation. HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is often known as the “good” cholesterol. People who have higher levels of HDL usually have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems, including people with type 2 diabetes. In some studies referenced in a 2021 review of research, eating one egg daily was associated with increases in HDL cholesterol and decreases in LDL cholesterol. However, the authors note that the scientific community is currently divided about the impact of eggs on cholesterol due to mixed results. Some people’s cholesterol may react differently to eggs. If you have high cholesterol, it may be best to talk with a doctor before eating eggs regularly. Eggs are a good dietary source of choline, an important nutrient often grouped with the B vitamins. Choline is used to build cell membranes and has various other functions, including producing signaling molecules in the brain. A deficiency in this nutrient can cause serious symptoms, but because the body makes choline, deficiency is not common. However, people who are pregnant or have certain genetic alterations may be more likely to have a choline deficiency. Whole eggs are an excellent source of choline. A single egg contains about LDL cholesterol is generally known as the “bad” cholesterol. Having high levels of LDL LDL is divided into subtypes based on the size of the particles. There are small, dense LDL particles and large LDL particles. Many studies included in a 2021 review of research suggest that people who have predominantly small, dense LDL particles have a higher risk of heart disease than people who have mostly large LDL particles. Even if eggs tend to mildly raise LDL cholesterol in some people, some However, recent studies on populations in the United States and Italy have found egg consumption to be linked with an increased risk of death from heart disease and from One of the consequences of aging is that eyesight tends to get worse. Eggs contain several nutrients that help counteract some of the degenerative processes that can affect our eyes. Two of these are called lutein and zeaxanthin. They are powerful antioxidants that accumulate in the retina of the eye. A 2022 review of research suggests consuming adequate amounts of these nutrients can significantly reduce the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, two very common eye disorders. Egg yolks contain large amounts of both lutein and zeaxanthin. In an Eggs are also high in vitamin A, which deserves another mention here. Vitamin A deficiency is a Not all eggs are created equal. Their nutrient composition varies depending on how the hens were fed and raised. Eggs from hens that were raised on pasture and/or fed omega-3 enriched feeds tend to be much higher in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids Studies suggest consuming omega-3-enriched eggs can effectively help lower blood triglycerides. A small 2020 study of 20 participants found eating 2 omega-3-enriched eggs daily for five weeks reduced triglycerides by 10%. However, additional research with larger groups of participants is still needed. Proteins are the main building blocks of the human body. They’re used to make all sorts of tissues and molecules that serve both structural and functional purposes. It is important to get enough protein in the diet, and research suggests that the currently recommended amounts may be too low. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, with a single large egg containing six grams of it. Eggs also contain all the essential amino acids in the right ratios, so your body is well-equipped to make full use of the protein in them. Eating enough protein may help with: Eggs are incredibly filling. They are a high protein food, and protein is a satiating macronutrient. Eggs score high on a scale called the satiety index, which measures foods’ ability to cause feelings of fullness and reduce later calorie intake, according to a In one study of 50 adults who were overweight or had obesity, eating eggs and toast instead of cereal and milk with orange juice decreased feelings of hunger following the meal, prolonged the period of not being hungry and made them eat ~180 calories less at lunch 4 hours later. In Is it healthy to eat eggs every day? It may be safe for people without high cholesterol to eat at least one egg daily. However, how blood cholesterol can respond to eating eggs can vary by person.

While eggs are high in cholesterol, research is mixed on whether dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol for everyone. For most people, eating eggs daily is likely safe and a beneficial source of protein and vitamins. However, people with high cholesterol levels may want to talk with a doctor before drastically increasing their egg consumption."
