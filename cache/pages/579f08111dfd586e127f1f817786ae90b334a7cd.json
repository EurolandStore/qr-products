You can also view the time difference between your location and that of another city. The home page displays the clock with the exact time in your region, as well as a pre-installed list of clocks for major cities. You can modify this list as you wish. For any city in the list, you can open a separate page with a clock by clicking on the title with the name of the city. You can configure the clock appearance (text color, type, and size), and these settings will be saved; they will be used when you open your web browser next time."
