FAQs How much is NordVPN? NordVPN offers several plans, and generally speaking, the longer the plan, the better value you'll get. 2-year plan: $3.49 a month 1-year plan: $4.99 a month 1-month plan: $12.99 a month Be aware that prices frequently change, so click through to find the best price. Is NordVPN good? Well, in our hands-on review of the provider, it proved almost perfect in every way and earned itself #2 in our rankings – only bested by the more expensive ExpressVPN. You can learn more in our in-depth rundown of ExpressVPN vs NordVPN. What makes NordVPN so appealing is its Jack-of-all-trades approach to VPN. Want to unblock streaming services worldwide? You got it. Need extra privacy on public Wi-Fi? No problem. You'll even be able to use it to stay safe as a torrenting VPN, and it's even one of the fastest VPNs we've ever tested. In short, few providers offer comparable all-around performance to NordVPN, and the price is not bad. How many devices does NordVPN allow? While NordVPN supports a wide range of devices and platforms, a single subscription is restricted to 6 devices. That's more than enough for most people, and if you need to use it on more than 6, you can log out of another. However, if you're looking for a provider you can install on all your devices, Surfshark is your best. It offers unlimited simultaneous connections, is our #3-rated provider, and is a capable cheap VPN. Does NordVPN work with Netflix? NordVPN is our #1-rated Netflix VPN and can access many libraries worldwide. In our testing, we've found that NordVPN can unblock libraries in Japan, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and India—and we expect it to be effective in plenty more locations. To do this, select your streaming VPN location and connect to the NordVPN app. Then, open Netflix and search for the geo-blocked content you want to watch. It should appear, so get watching! If you're having trouble with a particular location, try disconnecting and reconnecting once or twice. If that's not working, contact the live chat team—we've always found them to be friendly and helpful. Does NordVPN have a free trial? Android users can claim a 7-day NordVPN free trial by downloading the app from the Play Store and submitting credit card details. This VPN free trial will get you a week of unlimited usage – but after 7 days, you'll be billed at a high rate. We reckon taking advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee is a better option. You'll have longer to test out the service, and, as outlined above, it's super simple to claim your refund if you don't want to stay with Nord. Plus, you'll get the best price if you do choose to stay. NordVPN Saving tips Watch out for promotional deals NordVPN often offers a range of VPN deals which can lower price by as much as 80% depending on which plans you choose and how long you commit to them for. We also see significant savings on offer around Black Friday each year, so check in around key holidays for bigger chances to save. Look for bundles If you're in the market for more than just a VPN, you might be able to get a discount on a number of services by buying a bundle that includes additional extras like the brand's password manager, secure cloud storage, or a data breach scanner. These bundles can work out as much as 30% cheaper than paying for each service separately. Get a student discount Students can receive an exclusive 69% off their NordVPN 2-year plan when they confirm their education status using StudentBeans or Youth Discount. Just sign in to your account before making your purchase to redeem this deal. Refer a friend Share the love and keep your friends safe online with NordVPN's refer-a-friend program. You'll receive 3 months for free for each friend you refer to NordVPN, and your friends will also get 3 months for free. Use the money-back guarantee If you just want to test out NordVPN, you have 30 days from when you start your plan to claim a refund if you decide its not for you, giving you plenty of time to try the service before you're locked in for good. While you must pay upfront, you can get all your money back if you decide to cancel and claim your refund in time.

How we source coupon codes Whether it's through our affiliate networks, the depths of the world wide web, or our connections with big name brands, here at TechRadar we use every tool at our disposal to source the latest codes. Our coupons team updates each of our pages multiple times a week with the most recent deals, including exclusive coupons negotiated by our Commercial team. We also include the latest sales info directly from retailers to offer the most up-to-date discounts around. How we test coupon codes Each coupon you find on TechRadar has been tested before being uploaded by our dedicated Deals & Offers teams. You’ll see a range of offers, from free shipping to student discounts, with savings available on all kinds of products & services. To make sure every coupon is ready to use, we don’t list any user-specific or one-time codes. We also include all relevant information about coupons, such as expiry dates and any terms & conditions, near the ‘Get Code’ button. You can see the details for an individual offer by clicking on the ‘Terms & Conditions’ text below the code and expanding the code area. What to do if a coupon code doesn’t work Although we do our best to ensure all listed codes are tried & tested, sometimes coupons expire or terms & conditions are changed before we can update pages. Our team works hard to make sure our coupons are active and work as intended, and should you encounter an issue when using one, we’ll work just as hard to help. The best place to start is by checking the requirements. Click “View terms and conditions” to expand the code section and see any guidance on your chosen coupon. For example, you may need to meet a minimum spend, add other items to your basket to qualify for a multibuy offer, or confirm that your chosen code applies to the items in your basket (i.e. 10% off laptops). If you’re still having issues using your code, you can email our customer service team on coupons.techradar@futurenet.com. Include as many details as possible - such as which code you used and which coupon page it’s listed on so our team can address your issue as fast as possible. How we make money When it comes to coupons, TechRadar earns money via a commission-based model. For every brand we have a coupon page for, we’ve negotiated a deal that means we earn a percentage of total basket value in commission back from every order. Using this model means we can offer our coupons to our customers free of charge. You won’t pay any fees to add your chosen coupon to your basket - you’ll simply pay the final order total once your discount has been applied. If you want to find out more about TechRadar’s coupons pages, you can visit our dedicated page on How We Source Coupon Codes and How to Use Them for more information.
