  "text": "Reviews from our students Jesse Gardner I'm enjoying the course so far. I am very busy, and the course has to this point presented sufficient material to be challenging, while not giving me so much information that I fall behind due to my other obligations. Sarah Ellisor I love the self paced aspect of learning through Berges Institute. There are plenty of class options during the week that will fit a flexible work schedule. I have enjoyed meeting and getting to know the teachers as well as learning from them. Terri Hazelwood - ACXIOM I fully enjoyed the course, and it was very challenging. I would recommend it to everyone interested in learning Spanish. L. I have enjoyed the beginning Spanish Level 1 classes. All of the instructors have bben encouraging and extremely knowledgeable. Murali Durbha - ACXIOM Really enjoyed the course, and learnt a lot. Richie Graham - ACXIOM I learned more in the few weeks of this small group course than I did in a one-on-one tutoring course of similar length from another company. Michael Witherspoon - ACXIOM This course was excellent. As a career technical instructor, I appreciate effective course materials and talented instructors. This course had both. It is for absolute beginners but I came in with a fair amount of proficiency in Spanish. Despite my prior knowledge, Juan Carlos taught me many nuances I did not already know. He was also able to shore up some weaknesses in my basic Spanish. Now, I have even greater confidence in conversation with Spanish-speaking people. Leah H. This course was very informative, well organized and easy to follow. The ability to take classes at my own pace is appreciated and helpful. I would recommend this course to friends and family. Manuela Coppock I enjoyed the beginner level course. the majority of classes I took with Silas, and he is a very good teacher. I am looking forward to level 2. Suzan Sayder An excellent experience overall. Brenda Burdick The course gives a good structure to learn Spanish. I do use other resources to fill-in and this is reasonable as the course price is affordable and learning anything like a language must come from a myriad of experiences. The structure this course provides if vital and this program also gives me the necessary building blocks. The online flexiliblity of the course offers with 'live' classroom availability is important for learning, as well. Excellent foundation provided where I do not believe you can get anywhere else especially at this price point. Crystal Hilliard I was originally intimidated about starting level one. Because since it was only 10 classes I assumed it would be very fast-paced. I did not know if would not be able to keep up and understand so I was already doubting myself. My instructor Monica was awesome , she went at a great speed any many things from high were starting to come back. I was able to understand quicker than I thought, but you REALLY must practice outside of the once per week class to keep your mind from forgetting. Level 1 was very fun, . I passed my exam!!!! I am ready for level 2. Rebecca Murray I loved my class experience with Marian. The flexibility with scheduling is a huge advantage, and I'm encouraged by how much content I'm already able to comprehend during my day to day experience. I scheduled the next unit! Diana Minor I have recently completed Level 1 for Beginners. I am very happy with the courses so far and feel I have learned a lot. I was able to have simple conversations with other students in class using the words we had learned. I need more to be able to actually converse with friends or strangers so I have already signed up for Level 2. I am older so learning something new does not come as fast as when I was younger. Steven Fedorovsky Well structured and informative course Trina Thompson En general, el nivel de español para principiantes absolutos es de cinco estrellas más A+++.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 David Shutoff I thoroughly enjoyed this course and felt like I made great progress over the 10 lessons. I appreciated the small group size which always allowed for lots of interaction with fellow students and the opportunity to ask as many questions as needed of the instructor. I have tried learning on apps like Duolingo before and while that route is obviously less expensive, I did not find it to be nearly as effective as Berges. I'm looking forward to continuing with Unit 2! Frequently asked questions How long does it take to learn Spanish with this method? Most students become conversational after completing 5 levels (about 12-15 months of regular classes). I've never studied Spanish before. Is this right for me? Yes! Most of our students are complete beginners. We designed our Beginners classes specifically for people with zero Spanish experience. Will I be embarrassed in class as a beginner? No. All Beginners students start at zero. Our teachers create a supportive environment where making mistakes is part of learning. How is this different from Spanish apps? We teach grammar rules first, then practice. Apps make you guess patterns. Our method is faster for adults."
