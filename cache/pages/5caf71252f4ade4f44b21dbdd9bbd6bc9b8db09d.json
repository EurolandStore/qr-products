  "text": "International Classification of Headache Disorders The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is a detailed hierarchical classification of all headache-related disorders published by the International Headache Society.[1] It is considered the official classification of headaches by the World Health Organization, and, in 1992, was incorporated into the 10th edition of their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).[2] Each class of headache contains explicit diagnostic criteria—meaning that the criteria include quantities rather than vague terms like several or usually—that are based on clinical and laboratory observations.[2] The ICHD was first published in 1988 (now known as the ICHD-1). A second version, the ICHD-2, was published in 2004. The most current version, ICHD-3, was published in 2018.[3][4] Hierarchy [edit]Primary headaches [edit]ICHD 1, ICD10 G43: Migraine [edit]- Migraine without aura - Migraine with aura - Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine -
