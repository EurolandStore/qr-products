  "text": "'David' - Review Thread From the songs of his mother's heart to the whispers of a faithful God, David's story begins in quiet devotion. When the giant Goliath rises to terrorize a nation, a young shepherd armed with only a sling, a few stones, and unshakable faith steps forward. Pursued by power and driven by purpose, his journey tests the limits of loyalty, love, and courage--culminating in a battle not just for a crown, but for the soul of a kingdom. Cast: Phil Wickham, Lauren Diagle, Brandon Engman, Asim Chaudry, Mick Wingert Rotten Tomatoes: 100% (3 reviews) No Metacritic score yet Some reviews: Cain Noble-Davies, FILMINK (Australia) 12/20 - … more a scattershot of pebbles than a well-aimed stone … https://www.filmink.com.au/reviews/david/ Hosea Rupprecht, Pauline Media Studies - David would make a great family outing for Christmas. It’s kid-friendly, even the parts where David and Saul are fighting, and the overarching theme of trust in God, no matter how bad things get, is a reminder we all need. https://pauline.org/film-tv-reviews/david-total-trust-in-god/ Brett McCracken, The Gospel Coalition - Certainly the best Bible-themed animated musical since DreamWorks’s Prince of Egypt (1998), and arguably more biblically faithful and artistically rich. https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/david-christian-movie-review/ Rotten Tomatoes page: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/david_2025/reviews?type=all-critics"
