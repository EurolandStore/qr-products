Suppose unsigned_foo is an unsigned long , then I try: printf(\"%lu\\n\", unsigned_foo) printf(\"%du\\n\", unsigned_foo) printf(\"%ud\\n\", unsigned_foo) printf(\"%ll\\n\", unsigned_foo) printf(\"%ld\\n\", unsigned_foo) printf(\"%dl\\n\", unsigned_foo) And all of them print some kind of -123123123 number instead of unsigned long that I have."
