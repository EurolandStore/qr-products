  "text": "The thymus gland is located in the chest behind the breastbone. Its functions include producing white blood cells known as T cells, which aid in immunity. It also contributes to the production of hormones such as insulin. The organ’s Additionally, the thymus produces an array of hormones. Some of these, like thymulin and thymosin, regulate immune cell production. The thymus also synthesizes hormones such as insulin and melatonin. It is relatively large in infants and children. After puberty, it decreases in size, and is very small in older adults. Read on to learn about the thymus’s function, location, and more. The The thymus is responsible for producing and maturing lymphocytes, or immune cells. These include T cells, a type of white blood cell that defends the body from infections. Additionally, the thymus suppresses the effects of aging, according to a 2016 study. Hormones released by the thymus inhibit the aging processes. They also help retain learning and memory capabilities. The thymus is It is in front of the ascending aorta, a large blood vessel coming from the heart. The It is large in infants and young children, but it decreases in size after puberty. By the time a person reaches early adulthood, fat has largely The size of the thymus is very small in older adults. The thymus produces several hormones. Most notably, it produces thymosin, which stimulates T cell production. Researchers think thymosin acts upon the T cells that have matured in the thymus and prepares them for use throughout the body. When T cells mature within the thymus, they are not capable of fighting viruses, bacteria, and foreign antigens. After the T cells leave the thymus, thymosin ensures they undergo complete maturation. This makes them capable of performing their duties as part of the immune system and protecting the body from harm. Additionally, research indicates that thymosin and other thymic hormones inhibit aging. Some of these effects involve helping preserve learning and memory capacity as people age. The thymus also makes hormones that are similar to the hormones other glands in the body produce. They include: The thymus contains various types of cells including epithelial and lymphatic cells. They include: T cells The thymus matures T cells which critically support the immune system. Once fully mature, they B cells The thymus also has a small population of B lymphocytes, or B cells. Research shows that thymic B cells aid in negative selection of lymphocytes. This means they detect potentially harmful cells that interact too strongly with antigens, which are toxins. Although thymic B cells play an important role in maintaining healthy cells, their function is not fully understood. Researchers are further investigating how they work. Conditions causing dysfunction of the thymus gland can Here are some of the most common conditions: Hyperactivity Various disorders can enlarge the thymus and cause it to become hyperactive, or overly active. These may include: - tumors of the thymus - cancers of the lymphatic system - myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease involving muscle weakness - systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease affecting the skin, joints, brain, kidneys, and other organs - hyperthyroidism, the increased production of thyroid hormones Symptoms of a hyperactive thymus include: Small size or atrophy Usually, the thymus is largest in babies and young children. However, some preterm newborns may have a small thymus. This can increase their risk of infections. When people age, their thymus atrophies, or decreases in size. This raises their likelihood of developing: - cancer - viral and bacterial infections - autoimmune diseases Thymus cancer The thymus may develop Thymoma is a slow-growing cancer that rarely spreads beyond the thymus. Thymic carcinoma is a faster-growing cancer that is harder to treat. Symptoms of these cancers may include: - persistent cough - shortness of breath - hoarse voice - chest pain - swelling in the neck, face, arms, or upper body The thymus is an organ in the upper chest. It is largest in infants and young children, and it decreases in size after puberty. It plays a critical role in immunity. Its The thymus also contains B cells. They help the thymus select the best T cells while disposing of potentially harmful ones. Conditions affecting the thymus include hyperactivity from enlargement, cancer, and atrophy."
