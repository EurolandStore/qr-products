  "text": "A web frontend for the headscale Tailscale-compatible coordination server. Warning The latest major release of headscale ui change the default container ports from 80 and 443 to 8080 and 8443 respectively. If you are using the HTTP_PORT or HTTPS_PORT environment variables this does not affect you, otherwise you need to change your ports in your docker-compose or kubernetes manifests. Headscale-UI is currently released as a static site: just take the release and host with your favorite web server. Headscale-UI expects to be served from the /web path to avoid overlap with headscale on the same domain. Note that due to CORS (see juanfont/headscale#623), headscale UI must be served on the same subdomain, or CORS headers injected via reverse proxy. If you are using docker, you can install headscale alongside headscale-ui , like so: version: '3.5' services: headscale: image: headscale/headscale:stable container_name: headscale volumes: - ./container-config:/etc/headscale - ./container-data/data:/var/lib/headscale # ports: # - 27896:8080 command: serve restart: unless-stopped headscale-ui: image: ghcr.io/gurucomputing/headscale-ui:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: headscale-ui # ports: # - 8443:8443 # - 8080:8080 Headscale UI serves on port 8080/8443 and uses a self signed cert by default. You will need to add a config.yaml file under your container-config folder so that headscale has all of the required settings declared. An example from the official headscale repo is here. The docker container lets you set the following settings: You will need a reverse proxy to install headscale-ui on your domain. Here is an example Caddy Config to achieve this: https://hs.yourdomain.com.au { reverse_proxy /web* http://headscale-ui:8080 reverse_proxy * http://headscale:8080 } If you do not want to configure headscale-ui on the same subdomain as headscale, you must intercept headscale traffic via your reverse proxy to fix CORS (see juanfont/headscale#623). Here is an example fix with Caddy, replacing your headscale UI domain with hs-ui.yourdomain.com.au : https://hs.yourdomain.com.au { @hs-options { host hs.yourdomain.com.au method OPTIONS } @hs-other { host hs.yourdomain.com.au } handle @hs-options { header { Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://hs-ui.yourdomain.au Access-Control-Allow-Headers * Access-Control-Allow-Methods \"POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE\" } respond 204 } handle @hs-other { reverse_proxy http://headscale:8080 { header_down Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://hs-ui.yourdomain.com.au header_down Access-Control-Allow-Methods \"POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE\" header_down Access-Control-Allow-Headers * } } } See Other Configurations for further proxy examples, such as Traefik The following versions correspond to the appropriate headscale version Make sure you are using the latest version of headscale. Headscale-UI is only tested against: - The current stable version of headscale - Chrome/Chrome Mobile - Firefox/Firefox Mobile Note that while mobile is checked for functionality, the web experience is not mobile optimised. If you are getting errors about preflight checks, it's probably CORS related. Make sure your UI sits on the same subdomain as headscale or inject CORS headers. Your API key is either not saved or you haven't configured your reverse proxy. Create an API key in headscale (via command line) with headscale apikeys create or docker exec <headscale container> headscale apikeys create and save it in settings . HS-UI has to be ran on the same subdomain as headscale or you need to configure CORS. Yes you need to use a reverse proxy to do this. Use a reverse proxy. If you are trying to use raw IPs and ports, it will not work. see security for details see development for details see style for details See architecture for details"
