  "text": "Ramazan Bayramı 2026, 2027 and 2028 in Turkey The Eid al-Fitr celebration is called “Ramazan Bayrami” in Turkey and begins at sunset on the final day of Ramadan. The holiday is also sometimes called “Sheker Bayrami”, meaning “Sugar Festival”, because of all the candy and sweets that are consumed when fasting is over. Ramazan Bayramı has public holiday status and actually lasts for three full days. People will attend Eid prayers on the morning of the first of Shawwal as in other lands, and they will often wear new clothes, give small gifts to children, visit friends and relatives, send Eid greeting cards, and indulge in large family feasts. One very Turkish tradition for Eid is to stand outside in broad daylight to drink down rich Turkish coffee (or tea) since such drinks were given up during daylight hours during the preceding month of Ramadan."
