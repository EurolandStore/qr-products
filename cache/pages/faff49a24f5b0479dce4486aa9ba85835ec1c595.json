  "text": "Why do we have both the word \"three\" and the numeral \"3\" in this sentence? The number 345 has three digits, where the first digit is a 3. Why do we have both the word \"three\" and the numeral \"3\" in this sentence? The number 345 has three digits, where the first digit is a 3. Because there we are talking about literal verbatim symbols 345 and 3 written out as numerals, not about three whatevers, which is different. Depending on the context, that might have been more clearly typeset in any of these fashions: 345 has three digits, where the first digit is a 3 .I leave as an exercise for the reader to decide whether mentions of the word number in this sentence should or could be better written saying numeral instead. This was already adequately addressed in your other post. To summarise: Whether in mathematical writing or newsprint, The number 2 is the only even prime is better than The number two is the only even prime (here, '2' is a mathematical object of interest);This equation has two solutions: 5 and 7 is better than This equation has 2 solutions: 5 and 7 or This equation has two solutions: five and seven (here, the count 'two' is being distinguished from the mathematical objects of interest '5' and '7');a function of two variables and a function of 2 variables are both fine, unless the house style guide specifically prescribes the former.As an example, consider this post, where the number 3 was deliberately spelt out in the second paragraph, and deliberately written as a numeral in the third paragraph."
