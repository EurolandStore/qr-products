Best but slow in picking up downloads from the browser Best but slow in picking up downloads from the browser Why is Free Download Manager exhibiting this message: \"Parsing failure: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined\" ? Could you please solve this problem? It's bugging me out, FDM seems to be not working anymore, it's an excellent program but it is failing. The best one ever! I can download any videos or files more easily than using IDM. Really you can rely on FDM <3 Now I can not download any video by FDM. The dialog box appeared and containing the video URL and The circle at the left bottom corn still rotates more and more without showing the next dialog box which displays video name and size. After long time a message in RED COLOR appears telling me the remote server didn't respond, in the same time the browser downloader can download the same video at once. Please advise."
