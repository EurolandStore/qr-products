  "text": "Pornhub is undergoing maintenance bug / error ... Hello community, i have got a question for the people who have a collection of their favorite PH-videos saved as Google Chrome Bookmarks . When I open like 100 videos from one of the bookmark folders at once, Pornhub crashes and shows me a \"pornhub is undergoing maintenance error\" on every page. This also happens when casually browsing Pornhub or when opening like 3 links in quick succession. This makes browsing Pornhub very user unfriendly. Apparently Pornhub protects itself from too many link accesses at once? Do you have this problem too? Is it better with other browsers? Edit: I have messaged and forwared your complaints to the PH-support like 3 times now. Edit2: Official answer: Greetings, The behavior you are encountering is by design and put in place to prevent server issues. We appreciate your feedback however there are no plans to change the way the website is currently designed. Regards Pornhub Support"
