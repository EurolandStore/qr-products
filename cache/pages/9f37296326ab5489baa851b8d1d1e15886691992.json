  "text": "Moving trucks: Home Depot or UHaul? I’m moving from a studio apartment, so I really don’t have too much stuff. I definitely need a cargo van though, otherwise I’d be making 10 trips in my car. I read that UHaul isn’t very transparent with their pricing and they tack on a lot of fees. Home Depot on the other hand seems more upfront with a flat rate for the day, so I’m leaning towards them. Anyone have experience with their company? Any recommendations?"
