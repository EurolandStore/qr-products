  "text": "EMV is the payment technology used by all credit cards and debit cards that have an embedded computer chip, which lets the cardholder make transactions more securely. To make purchases, you insert your card’s chip into an EMV card reader, and then you may be asked to provide either a PIN or your signature for validation. EMV technology is now the standard for all of the world’s biggest card networks. Many EMV cards also support contactless payments. Key Things to Know About EMV - Security benefits: EMV cards are more secure than cards that only have a magnetic stripe, which is one of several reasons why the U.S. – and much of the world – has made the switch. - Late adoption: The U.S. didn’t start adopting EMV until recent years, with the biggest shift triggered by a 2015 adjustment to fraud liability standards for payments. - Merchant liability: Merchants that don’t have EMV-compatible card readers can be held liable for fraudulent transactions made with EMV-enabled cards. - 2026 status: The U.S. has transitioned nearly all of its payment cards to EMV technology, and most merchants have EMV-enabled readers. What Does EMV Stand for? \"EMV\" stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, the companies that developed EMV payment technology in 1994. Mastercard and Visa are still around today, but Europay merged with Mastercard in 2002 to become Mastercard Worldwide. That’s why Europay isn’t listed among the companies that currently manage EMV technology through EMVCo (Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover, JCB, and UnionPay). How Does EMV Work? EMV works by using a computer chip built into payment cards (credit and debit) to generate a unique code for every transaction. There are also special card readers made to scan those chips. The computer chip enables a greater level of encryption and security than a card that only has a magnetic stripe that you swipe. Since the generated code is unique for every transaction, it’s nearly impossible to clone and create a counterfeit EMV credit card. It’s important to note that not every merchant has a credit card reader that can read chips, which is why EMV cards in the U.S. also have the traditional magnetic stripe. You lose out on the extra security offered by EMV technology when you swipe, though. What Are EMV Chip Cards? An EMV chip card is simply any credit or debit card that has an EMV chip embedded in it. There are two types of EMV cards, chip-and-PIN and chip-and-signature: - A chip-and-PIN card uses a PIN to authenticate your transaction. - A chip-and-signature card uses a signature for authorization instead. - Chip-and-PIN cards are more secure, as it’s easier to fake a signature than it is to guess a PIN. While the technology involved in EMV credit cards is pretty complicated, using an EMV card is actually quite simple. How to Use an EMV Card - Have the merchant ring up your purchase. - Dip your card in the reader, inserting the end with the chip face up. - Enter your PIN or provide your signature, depending on the card. - Confirm the transaction. - Remove your card when prompted. EMV cards can also be enabled to work with contactless payment readers. Instead of dipping or swiping the card, you tap it against a scanner that is equipped with NFC (near field communication) technology. This technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it’s even more secure than EMV alone since it protects you from credit card skimming devices placed on payment terminals by fraudsters. Benefits of EMV Security EMV chips are better encrypted than magnetic stripes and create unique transaction codes that can’t be used again. Universality Credit cards that have an EMV chip can still be used at merchants that don’t have EMV terminals. You can just swipe the magnetic stripe on the card instead. Foreign use Foreign EMV credit cards are usually chip-and-pin, but you can still use a chip-and-signature card at most foreign merchants without issue, unlike a card with only a magnetic stripe. The only places you might have trouble are at automatic kiosks or gas pumps, where you could need a chip-and-pin card or cash. Contactless EMV cards can support contactless payments, and this technology has seen widespread adoption in recent years. It’s up to the card issuer to include contactless capability or not, but it’s estimated that virtually all cards will have contactless payments enabled by 2027. Offline EMV supports offline transaction verification for some chip-and-pin cards, meaning purchases can be processed without internet connectivity. This is not possible with older card readers or cards with only a magnetic stripe. Popular EMV Credit Cards in 2026 Opinions and ratings are our own.

The best EMV chip credit cards offer worldwide acceptance, and there are options that don’t charge foreign transaction fees, allowing cardholders to make purchases internationally at no extra cost.

If you’re looking for more great offers to consider, be sure to compare chip and PIN credit cards, as well as credit cards with no foreign transaction fees and the year’s best international credit cards. EMV in the U.S. The U.S. was slower to adopt EMV technology than a lot of countries, but we’ve just about completed the transition in the past few years when it comes to payment cards. Merchants have lagged behind card issuers in adopting the technology, despite the fact that not upgrading puts the liability for fraud on the merchant. EMV Credit Cards & Debit Cards The majority of credit cards and debit cards in the U.S. (more than 66%) are now EMV cards. Plus, more than 90% of all in-person credit and debit card transactions made in the U.S. use EMV technology, according to EMVCo. EMV in the U.S. still is a bit different than in the rest of the world, though. Currently, debit cards in the U.S. tend to be chip-and-PIN, while credit cards are usually chip-and-signature. Outside of the U.S., it’s more common for credit cards to be chip-and-PIN. In addition, many EMV cards in the U.S. have Some issuers that offer contactless cards include Chase, Bank of America, American Express, Capital One, Citi, Discover and U.S. Bank. EMV for Merchants Around 75% of stores in the U.S. – over 3.5 million merchants total – had EMV terminals as of 2019, according to Visa. That was a big jump from the fewer than 400,000 merchants that had EMV-compatible readers in 2015. We’ve continued making progress since then. In fact, more than 85% of merchants in the U.S. had EMV-compatible payment terminals as of 2023. We should expect that number to keep increasing in the future as even more cards transition to having EMV chips and the technology becomes increasingly widespread. When merchants don’t upgrade to EMV readers, they risk losing money if they’re held accountable for fraudulent purchases. EMV terminals can be expensive, often costing a few hundred dollars each, but making the upgrade is worth it in the long run. Plus, small businesses can also consider alternatives, such as using inexpensive EMV readers from companies like Square to process transactions (though there are transaction fees to watch out for)."
