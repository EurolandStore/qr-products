I'm crying with a knife, wanna take my life, never treats me right [Chorus] Baby, I'm your possession, handle me like a weapon Gaslight me right, tell me, \"Keep quiet\" I'll go along, di-di-dum Put me up like a prize, I'll be a good housewife You won't see me cry when women come by I'll go along, di-di-dum [Post-Chorus] Dum, dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum Dum, dum, dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum Dum, dum, dum, di-di-dum, di-di, dum, di-di-dum Dum, dum, dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum, di-di-dum [Outro] Took the keys and left, drove into a tree Walked around for a minute, people starin' at me A concussion reversin' all the damage I had May be bruised, but it's not that bad About “POSSESSION” marks Melanie Martinez’s debut single after the release of PORTALS in 2023.
