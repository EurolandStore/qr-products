  "text": "Wordle Solver The Fastest Wordle Word Finder Wordle Solver — The Ultimate Wordle Helper Wordle is a simple yet addictive online word game that took the internet by storm in late 2021. The premise is straightforward - players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback after each guess about which letters are correct or misplaced. While the core gameplay is not new, Wordle's elegant design, social shareability, and \"one puzzle per day\" model created the perfect viral loop. Within months, millions were playing this modest little word game created by software engineer Josh Wardle. The game only allows one Wordle puzzle to be played per day, which can lead to frustration if you get stuck! This is where a Wordle Solver tool like ours can come in handy. How to use our Wordle Solver Wordle Solver is a free online tool that helps you solve Wordle puzzles by narrowing down the possibilities and making smart suggestions. Here's how to use it to help you solve a Wordle puzzle when you get stuck: - Enter any green letters (correct letters in the right position) into the \"Correct Letters\" input box above. Make sure to enter them in the correct place as the order matters. - Enter any yellow letters (letters but in the wrong position) into the \"Misplaced Letters\" input box above. The order doesn't matter for these letters. - Enter any gray letters (letters that you know are not in the word) into the \"Excluded Letters\" input box above. The order doesn't matter for these letters either. - Click the Find Words button. The tool will filter the word list and display possible solutions based on your input. - Study the suggested words and select one as your next guess. - If you're still stuck, update the letters in the Solver based on your guess results and click the Find Words button again. Repeat this process of guessing, updating, and filtering words until you solve the puzzle. Dordle, Quordle, Octordle, and more Since Wordle exploded in popularity in late 2021, numerous spinoffs and variations have emerged that put unique twists on the simple yet addictive word guessing game. Our Wordle Solver can also be used to solve the spinoffs that maintain the same core gameplay, including Dordle (7 guesses to find 2 words), Quordle (9 guesses to find 4 words), and Octordle (13 guesses to find 8 words). The Best Starting Word for Wordle Choosing an optimal starting word is crucial in Wordle, as it can significantly reduce the number of possible solutions and help players solve the puzzle in as few guesses as possible. There is ongoing debate around the statistically best starting words, with different methods and analyses yielding different top choices. Some key factors to consider when selecting a starting word include: - Vowel coverage - Words with 2-3 vowels help eliminate possibilities quickly. Common vowels like A, E, O are especially useful. - Common consonants - Letters like S, T, R, N, L appear frequently in answers and are good to include. - Letter frequency analysis - Studying which letters appear most often in each position in the Wordle answers list can inform choices. - Information theory - Words that maximize entropy and information gain narrow down the answer space fastest on average. - Future guess strategy - A word that pairs well with high-value second guesses can optimize the two-turn information gain. Taking these factors into account, here are some of the top starting words suggested by different experts and analyses: - SLATE - Top choice of the New York Times' WordleBot AI assistant. Good coverage of vowels and common letters. - CRANE - Also rated highly by WordleBot. Swaps R for L in SLATE. - SALET - Chosen by MIT researchers applying information theory. Performs 1% better than SLATE. - SOARE - Has high entropy as calculated by mathematician Grant Sanderson (video). - RAISE - Contains the top 3 vowels and 2 most common consonants. - STARE - Highly effective in practice. Covers 3 common vowels plus R and T. - AROSE - Contains 3 vowels and two common consonants. - ADIEU - Contains 4 vowels. One of the most popular human choices."
