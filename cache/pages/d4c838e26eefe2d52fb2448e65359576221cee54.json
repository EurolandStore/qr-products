  "text": "billjustbill Bronze Member - #1 Thread Owner How valuable is \" 1/20 Gold Filled\" jewelry? What is meant by 1/20 Gold Filled? I bought a Walking Liberty half-dollar necklace with a bezel and rope necklace that are marked with that term. Apparently this item has a gold plated Walking Liberty and the eagle on the reverse covered with glass on both sides, and was sold back in the 1970's. Paid $10 for it in its case. Just don't know about gold filled. Thanks. What is meant by 1/20 Gold Filled? I bought a Walking Liberty half-dollar necklace with a bezel and rope necklace that are marked with that term.
