Nehalem Bay is a picturesque estuary located along Oregon's northern coast, nestled between the towns of Nehalem and Manzanita. With its abundant marine life, the bay offers a diverse range of fishing opportunities year-round. The bay is fed by the Nehalem River and connected to the Pacific Ocean, creating a dynamic environment that supports a variety of fish species. Anglers flock to Nehalem Bay for its scenic beauty and the thrill of catching prized species like salmon, steelhead, and Dungeness crab. Chinook Salmon, also known as King Salmon, are one of the most sought-after species in Nehalem Bay. These fish are known for their size and strength, often reaching weights of 20-50 pounds or more. The Chinook runs typically occur in the spring and fall, with the fall run being particularly popular among anglers. The fish migrate from the Pacific Ocean into the bay and up the Nehalem River to spawn, providing ample opportunities for catching these prized fish. Coho Salmon, or Silver Salmon, are another popular species in Nehalem Bay. They are smaller than Chinook but are known for their aggressive behavior and acrobatic leaps when hooked. Coho Salmon runs occur primarily in late summer and fall. These fish can be found in both the bay and the Nehalem River, and they respond well to a variety of fishing techniques, making them a favorite among sport fishers. Steelhead are a type of rainbow trout that migrate to the ocean and return to freshwater to spawn. Nehalem Bay and its surrounding rivers are home to both winter and summer runs of steelhead. Winter steelhead fishing is especially popular, with the fish typically entering the bay and river systems from December through March. Known for their fighting spirit, steelhead are a challenging and rewarding catch for anglers. Dungeness crab is a highly sought-after crustacean found in the estuarine waters of Nehalem Bay. Crabbing is a popular activity here, particularly during the fall and winter months when the crabs are most abundant. With the right bait and traps, you can easily catch your limit of these delicious crabs. The bay's sandy and muddy bottom provides an ideal habitat for Dungeness crabs, making it a prime spot for crabbing. Rockfish are commonly found in the rocky areas near the bay's jetty and the deeper waters of the Pacific Ocean just outside the bay. These fish are known for their tough fight and excellent table fare. Rockfish species vary in size and color, with some of the most common being black rockfish and blue rockfish. Bottom fishing techniques are most effective for catching rockfish. Sturgeon are ancient, prehistoric fish that inhabit the waters of Nehalem Bay and its tributaries. These fish can grow to be quite large, with some exceeding 10 feet in length and weighing several hundred pounds. Sturgeon fishing in Nehalem Bay is a unique experience, with catch-and-release regulations in place to protect this species. The best time for sturgeon fishing is typically in the spring and early summer. Read more: Nehalem Bay Sturgeon Fishing The timing of your fishing trip to Nehalem Bay can greatly impact your success. Different species have peak seasons, so it's important to plan accordingly: The mouth of the Nehalem River, where it meets the bay, is a hotspot for salmon fishing, particularly during the fall run. The tidal influence here creates strong currents that attract salmon as they prepare to enter the river to spawn. This area is also good for sturgeon and steelhead. The North and South jetties at the entrance of Nehalem Bay are popular spots for both fishing and crabbing. The rocky structure of the jetties provides an ideal habitat for rockfish, lingcod, and other bottom dwellers. Jetty fishing is often done from the shore, making it accessible for anglers without boats. Wheeler Marina, located on the Nehalem River, is a great starting point for fishing trips. The marina offers boat rentals, fishing charters, and easy access to some of the best fishing spots in the bay. From here, you can explore the tidal flats, river channels, and deeper waters of the bay. The expansive tidal flats within Nehalem Bay are prime crabbing territory. These shallow areas are rich in nutrients, attracting Dungeness crabs and other marine life. The tidal flats are accessible by boat, and many anglers use crab traps and rings to harvest crabs in this area. Trolling is the most effective method for catching salmon in Nehalem Bay. Using downriggers or lead weights, anglers troll lures or bait at varying depths to target Chinook and Coho salmon. The key is to adjust your trolling speed and depth based on the current and fish activity. Drift fishing involves casting your bait upstream and letting it drift naturally with the current. This technique is commonly used for steelhead fishing in the Nehalem River. The goal is to present the bait in a way that mimics the natural movement of food in the water, enticing steelhead to strike. Crabbing in Nehalem Bay requires the right gear, including crab traps, rings, and bait. Popular baits include chicken, fish carcasses, and squid. Set your traps in areas with good tidal flow and check them regularly. Be sure to follow local regulations regarding trap limits and size restrictions. Bottom fishing for rockfish is best done near rocky structures, such as the jetties or offshore reefs. Using a weighted rig with bait or artificial lures, drop your line to the bottom and wait for a bite. Rockfish are aggressive feeders, so be prepared for a strong fight once hooked.
