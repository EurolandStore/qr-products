Enjoy! 10 Craft Ideas To Do With Belle Coloring Pages Here are 10 affordable, fun, and creative craft ideas you can do with your completed coloring page! 10. Paper Dolls Have your kids color in the Belle figure of their choice – I recommend a detailed coloring page of Belle holding a rose or wearing the blue dress and walking with a basket. Then have them cut her out carefully along the lines. Next, they will put the cut-out against some cardstock and trace her shape. Then they’re also going to cut out the outline on the cardstock and then glue the two pieces together. You’re left with a lovely, sturdy paper doll that your kids can use to their heart’s – and imagination’s – content. 9. Belle With Buttons You’ll need many yellow and white (or pearly) buttons in different shades for this craft. You can find them at estate sales or yard sales or simply buy packs of them online. You’ll choose a Belle picture where she is wearing her ballgown (A detailed coloring page of Belle holding a rose is ideal). Then, using regular glue or hot glue, your kids are going to affix yellow buttons to her dress, mixing up the sizes and colors until the dress is totally filled in. It might help to lay out the buttons first, but you can also go for it! When they’re done, wait for the glue to dry completely, then put the page in a frame! 8. Crown Headbands To make this craft, you’ll use the Belle Crown Coloring Page; have your kids color it in with yellow and red. They will cut it out, except where the crown curves to show the back; they will simply cut it off so that all they are left with is the front piece. Then you’ll take two-inch strips of yellow construction paper and make loops that will fit over your kids’ heads. Glue the crowns to the front of the loops, and voilà – you have a tiara fit for a princess! 7. Mini-Beauty And The Beast Storybook Have your kids choose which illustration they’d like to color and write a line or two about what is happening in the picture. Then have them color it in and then when they’re done, collect the illustrations and take a three-hole punch to them. Bind the pages together using ribbon, twine, or yarn and marvel at the little storybook that they’ve created. 6. Bookmarks To make bookmarks, you’ll need to resize the images by copying/pasting them into a word processor; the main Belle figure should be four to six inches tall. Print that off and have your kids color in just Belle. Then they’re going to cut rectangles out of construction paper. They’ll cut out the Belle figure and paste her onto the construction paper rectangle. Punch a hole in the top and tie off five or six short pieces of yarn to finish. 5. Belle Mirrors To make Belle mirrors, you can use my Simple Outline of Princess Belle Holding a Rose or Belle With a Beautiful Dress Dancing With The Beast (among others). Roughly trace the shape of the mirror onto the illustration and color in just the parts that fall within the outline. Cut out along the oval; once you’ve done that, you can perfect the shape by holding it up to the mirror. You’ll Mod Podge the image onto the mirror, applying a few coats on the bottom and top. When the Mod Podge is dry, you have a beautiful accessory; it would also look so cute hung up on their bedroom wall! 4. Beauty And The Beast Trivia Pages For a Beauty and the Beast movie night, you can turn my coloring pages into little trivia activity sheets. Copy/paste the illustration into a word document and then fade the image out a bit. You’ll then place the text over the picture, questions like, “What does the enchantress offer the Prince in exchange for shelter?” or “What is Belle’s father’s profession?” 3. Tea Party Trays The perfect craft for a Beauty and the Beast birthday party, you’ll need inexpensive trays and Mod Podge. Have the kids color in the Belle of their choice and cut her out. They’ll then Mod Podge the figure to the tray; let it dry completely. They will have an adorable keepsake from the party and the perfect vessel to carry their teacups for their next tea party. 2. Party Invitations Copy/paste my Belle illustrations into a word processor and shrink it into the top-right corner of the page. Add the text, “You’re invited!” – upside down. In the bottom-right corner, fill in all the details, the what, where, when, etc. Print it off and then fold it in half once and then again. The illustration should be on the front page, and the details should be on the inside page. 1. Jewelry You will need shrink sheets and access to an oven to make jewelry. You’ll have the kids choose which Belle figures they want to use and color them in with markers. They’ll cut them out and punch holes where they want the jewelry hardware to go. Bake off the cut-outs according to the instructions and let cool completely. Then you have Belle figures that you can turn into dangly or post earrings, necklaces, or even bracelets (with added beads)."
