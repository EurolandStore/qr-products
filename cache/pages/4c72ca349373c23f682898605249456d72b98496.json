As the largest employer in the U.S., the federal government has a variety of career fields to suit your skills and interests. Visit Early careers for guides, programs and opportunities to help you launch a rewarding career in the federal government. The government is looking to fill positions that are in high demand. Find your opportunity to shape America's future. Below is an overview of the federal hiring process. This process is in place to make sure all applicants receive fair and equal opportunity. First, create and complete your profile to apply for any job on USAJOBS. With a USAJOBS profile, you can save jobs, automate job searches, and manage everything you need to complete your application, including resumes and required documents. Once you create your profile, you can search for jobs. It's best to sign into your profile before searching. Why? We can use your information to improve your job search results. You can also use filters such as location, salary, work schedule or agency to narrow your results. If you find a job you're interested in, read the entire announcement to determine if you're eligible and meet the qualifications. It's important to read the announcement because there are required qualifications you must meet and include in your application. Read the How to Apply section of the job announcement before starting your application. Click Apply, and we'll walk you through a five-step process where you'll attach a resume and any required documents. During the application process, you can review, edit and delete your information. We'll automatically save your progress as you go so that you won't lose any changes. When your application is ready, you'll be directed from USAJOBS to the hiring agency's system to submit your application. Before you submit, you may need to complete other agency-required steps such as a questionnaire or uploading additional documents. The time it takes to submit depends on the job you are applying for and the hiring agency's requirements. You can check your application using the Track This Application link in your USAJOBS profile or contact the hiring agency listed on the job announcement. The hiring agency begins reviewing applications when the job announcement closes. The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you're eligible and meet the qualifications for the position. The hiring agency will place applicants into quality categories. Those placed in the highest category are sent to the hiring official. The hiring official will review the highest qualified applications and select applicants to interview based on agency policy. The hiring agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews. You may be interviewed by a panel, in-person, video or phone interview, and there may be more than one interview round. For example, an applicant may have a phone interview and then an in-person interview. Scheduling an interview may take some time, depending on the number of applicants to interview. After all interviews are completed, the agency will select a candidate(s) and contact them to start the job offer process. For those not selected, the hiring agency will update the job's status to Hiring Complete. Hiring paths help you understand what jobs you are eligible to apply for and why. You may fall under multiple hiring paths."
