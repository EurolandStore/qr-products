With nearly 3,000 animals representing more than 300 species, the park’s zoological collection is a marquee attraction for families. With 10 thrilling coasters, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is known for the fastest, steepest, tallest coasters in the country. Iron Gwazi, the Parks newest and award-winning thrill ride, takes riders to new heights, plunging for 206 foot tall peak into a 91 degree drop and reaching top speeds of 76 miles per hour. Cheetah Hunt®, a triple-launch roller coaster, carries riders high above the park, and then races down along the ground through a rocky gorge. It is the park’s longest thrill ride and also innovatively integrates the coaster next to the Cheetah Run® animal habitat. Guests can get closer than ever to tigers in Jungala® and soar through the air on Montu®. And, for a behind-the-scenes look at how we care for animals, the Animal Care Center™ welcomes guests to closely observe the veterinary care and treatment we provide every day. The park also offers seasonal events including the terrifying Howl-O-Scream® and the holiday wonderland of Christmas Town™. Just across the street is the Adventure Island® water park featuring water slides, relaxin wave pools and other ways to have fun in the hot Florida sun.
