  "text": "Historically, this name served as a crowning honor for heroes in ancient Rome, and today, it retains that sense of dignity. While it had its massive popularity peak in the late 20th century, it has settled into a comfortable position as a familiar, beloved classic rather than an overused trend. Verdict: Laura is a perfect choice for a baby born in 2026 if you value timelessness over trendiness. It offers the beauty of recognition, everyone can spell and pronounce it, while currently sitting outside the “Top 100,” allowing your daughter to have a name that is universally known but uniquely hers in the classroom. Laura Overview - Meaning: Laura means “bay laurel,” symbolizing victory. - Gender: Laura is traditionally a girl’s name. - Origin: Laura originated in ancient Rome and came from a Latin word. - Pronunciation: Laura has several pronunciations but the most popular is “lor-ruh.” - Popularity: Laura is a popular name. - Nicknames: Lou, Lolo, Lau. - Variations: Lauren, Laurel, Lara, Lorna. - Namesakes: Laura Ingalls Wilder, pioneer wife and author of the Little House on the Prairie series. What Does Laura Mean? On the surface, the name Laura is the female version of the Latin word for the bay laurel plant. However, the etymology runs much deeper than botany. In Classical antiquity, the laurel tree was sacred to the god Apollo. Its leaves were woven into wreaths and crowns worn by victorious commanders, emperors, and athletes. Therefore, the true, nuanced meaning of Laura is “victory” or “crowned with honor.” It suggests a person of distinction and achievement. When you name a child Laura, you are giving them a moniker that implies triumph and prestige, rooted in thousands of years of Western history. Where Does the Name Laura Come From? Laura is of Latin origin, derived from the word “Laurus.” Its usage as a given name dates back to ancient Rome, though it was often associated with the phrase “laurea” (the laurel tree). The name gained immense romantic and literary significance in the 14th century due to the Italian Humanist poet Petrarch. He wrote hundreds of sonnets to a woman named Laura, his idealized muse who represented purity and unattainable beauty. This cemented the name in European culture, allowing it to spread through Italy, France, and eventually to England. It has been in consistent use in the English-speaking world since the 19th century. How Popular is the Name Laura? Laura is the definition of a “modern classic.” In terms of trajectory, it was a meteoric superstar of the mid-20th century. According to Social Security Administration data, Laura was a Top 20 name in the United States from 1963 all the way through 1985. It defined a generation of women, much like Jennifer or Jessica. In recent years, the name has cooled off significantly. It is no longer a “trendy” name, having dipped out of the Top 300. This is actually good news for modern parents; it means the name is widely recognized and beloved, but a baby Laura born in 2026 is unlikely to share her name with three other girls in her kindergarten class. It is currently in a “sweet spot” of rarity and familiarity. How Do I Pronounce Laura? In American English, the standard pronunciation is LOR-uh. The first syllable rhymes with “door.” However, because the name is used globally, there are valid variations: - LAW-ruh: A softer pronunciation common in parts of the UK and the American South. - L-OW-rah: The Spanish and Italian pronunciation, where the “au” creates a sound similar to “ow” (as in “wow”), and the “r” is slightly rolled. Is Laura a Boy or Girl Name? Laura is strictly a female name. While the root “Laurel” has occasionally been used for boys in deep history, Laura has maintained a feminine identity for centuries. The male equivalent would be Laurence, Lawrence, or Lars. Variations of Laura Laura is a true linguistic chameleon. Because of its Roman roots, almost every European language has adopted a version of this name. - Laure: French - Lara: Russian/Turkish - Lora: Italian/German spelling - Laurel: English (Nature variation) - Loretta: Italian (Diminutive) - Lowri: Welsh - Lavra: Slovene Nicknames for Laura Laura is short and sweet, so it doesn’t strictly require a nickname, but there are plenty of affectionate options available.
