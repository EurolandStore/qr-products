Learn more about The Spruce's Editorial Process Close Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault Bright, cheerful, and easy to grow, daisies are readily identifiable and are a mainstay of cottage gardens and classic perennial borders alike. The commonly known daisy has a yellow center and white petals, but there are more than 20,000 species of daisies that grow all over the world in a range of colors. There are also multitudes of options when it comes to choosing daisies to grow in your garden. What Are Daisies? The common name \"daisy\" is applied to a large handful of species within the huge Asteraceae family of plants, a group known for blooms that are flat and disc-shaped, with petals that form rays projecting outward from a central hub. The family also includes chrysanthemums, zinnias, asters, and sunflowers as well as many common weeds, such as dandelions. You can choose the right type of daisy for your garden by looking at the USDA Zone and your sun exposure. This will help you pick the best type of daisy to thrive in your space, provided you plant it in well-draining soil and the correct season. Ready to add cheerful color to your yard? Here are gorgeous species of daisies to consider for your garden. Warning Some types of daisies are considered weeds and are categorized by states as invasive (and thus discouraged), because they grow so rapidly, thanks to self-sowing and their robust nature. Check with your local county extension office before planting a new daisy variety. English Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova The common English daisy, Bellis perennis, has a somewhat deserved reputation for being a weed; it's considered invasive in some areas. The species has flowers with white rays and yellow centers, but there are many cultivars with semi-double and button flowers, such as 'Galaxy Red.' These cultivars are both showier and better behaved than the primary species. English daisies are hardy but are often grown as biennials in warmer zones and as annuals in cooler zones. These low-growing daisies, especially the showier cultivars, can make excellent ground cover plants. Native Area: Northern Africa, western Asia, EuropeUSDA Growing Zones: 4–8Height: 3–6 inchesSun Exposure: Full, dappled shadeFlower Color: Red, white, pink Gerbera Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova The National Garden Bureau named 2013 the Year of the Gerbera, declaring the pleasing shape and luminous colors of the flower to be irresistible to gardeners. Unlike some daisies, this South African native is a tender perennial, hardy only in warm climates. However, the plants can thrive in a container garden and make fabulous cut flowers, as many florists and brides can attest. Gerbera daisies, Gerbera jamesonii, also called Veldt Daisies, prefer morning sun. Irrigate the plants at the soil level to keep water off the foliage and prevent fungal diseases. Look for the Festival series in a rainbow of colors, or try one of the lush, semi-double types, such as the peach-hued Cartwheel Chardonnay. Native Area: South AfricaUSDA Growing Zones: 8–10b (grown as an annual elsewhere)Height: 12–18 inchesSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: Yellow, white, pink, red, orange, violet, lavender, salmon, and bicolored. Marguerite Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova The Marguerite daisy, Argyranthemum frutescens, also known as the cobbitty daisy, thrills gardeners with its vibrant colors. These are annuals in all but the warmest growing zones, so they won't return after winter, but you will get a full season of repeating blooms. Marguerite daisies are at their best during spring and fall when nighttime temperatures are below 75 degrees. However, if you shear them back in the summer, they'll bounce back with a new flush of blooms when the autumn rains arrive. Native Area: Canary Islands USDA Growing Zones: 10–11 (grown as an annual elsewhere) Height: 2–3 feet Sun Exposure: Full Flower Color: Yellow, pink, white Oxeye Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova What's considered a vigorous plant in one garden is considered a weed in another, and that's true for the oxeye daisy, Leucanthemum vulgare. These short-lived perennials are discouraged in a dozen continental states because they're considered invasive. However, in tamer settings, oxeye daisies are welcome for their three-month bloom time. Consider using them in a small, well-kept wildflower garden, or allow them to naturalize in your cottage garden. Native Area: EuropeUSDA Growing Zones: 3–8Height: 1–3 feetSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: White Painted Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova The ease of care and vivid blooms of the painted daisy, Tanacetum coccineum, make it deserving of a spot in every cutting garden. It starts blooming in early summer and may even put on a second, smaller showing in the fall if you deadhead the faded blooms. Varieties like 'James Kelway' are easy to start from seed or try the pale pink 'Eileen May Robinson.' Painted daisies grow well in warm weather, but when summer's high heat sets in, they may start to wilt. They'd rather be in drought than in sweltering, humid weather. Butterflies love these vibrant flowers but after the fernlike leaves appear in spring, watch out for aphids and leafminer. Native Area: Eastern Europe, Iran, and Central AsiaUSDA Growing Zones: 3–7Height: 2–3 feetSun Exposure: Full, PartialFlower Color: Blooms ranging from white to pink, red, crimson, and magenta Shasta Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova A cross of the oxeye daisy and three other wild daisies yielded the beloved Shasta daisy, Leucanthemum x superbum, which received its common name from the white snow of Mount Shasta in California. The many cultivars of this daisy offer gardeners several different looks for their flower borders. These plants bloom across a long season but peak in June and July. Although they're low-maintenance, Shasta daisies don’t like wet feet and will sometimes fail to reappear in the garden after a soggy winter. Divide the plants every two years to keep them vigorous. Native Area: Nursery hybrid; parent species are native to Europe, JapanUSDA Growing Zones: 4–9Height: 1–4 feetSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: White and yellow Swan River Daisy Credit: The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova A warm-weather perennial from Australia, the swan river daisy, Brachyscome iberidifolia, produces small flowers, only about 1 inch in diameter. But the blooms are so colorful and abundant—and the flower works so well with other garden plants—that it can serve as a central feature of any flower garden. Blooms appear in abundance from summer into fall, while the foliage is a softly textured gray-green hue.

These tall daisies are favorites of pollinators and bloom consistently throughout the summer and fall. They are easy to grow and provide color year after year, adding a cheerful touch to both wildflower-inspired gardens as well as flower gardens. They make an excellent backdrop behind a shorter border flower. Gloriosa daisies are also popular daisies for florists, and they're stunning in a summer or early fall bouquet.

This sunny daisy is fast-growing and will bloom continuously throughout the summer. They also put off a lovely fragrance that will draw in bees and give your garden a scent that's similar to chamomile.

These vibrant flowers are a favorite of gardeners because of their hardy nature, drought tolerance, and ability to attract pollinators of all kinds. If you decide to plant these perennials in your garden and don't get a bloom in the first year, don't despair. They can take up to two years to produce their first purple buds.

Their flowers are composed of two layers of petals measuring up to 4\" wide. The petals close up at night or anytime the sun isn't shining above. Conserving all that energy pays off—these flowers bloom from early spring through the first frost.

Chrysanthemum Credit: John Dreyer / Getty Images An abundant mound of chrysanthemums is a fall garden staple, but you may not have realized that mums are part of the daisy family. Mums are most often grown as annuals, with gardeners buying them just in time for a vibrant fall bloom. But the experts know that the trick is to buy chrysanthemums full of unopened buds—if you buy a plant full of blooms, your time with those flowers is limited. Keep in mind they need lots of water for consistently moist soil.

Gaillardia Daisy Credit: MsNancy / Getty Images The gorgeous shades of Gaillardia are also commonly called blanket flowers for their tendency to spread across the ground, forming a richly colored blanket. Each individual plant can quickly spread up to 20\", adding a vibrant look to a garden. If you want instant impact in your yard, look for blanket flowers in a nursery. If you decide to grow it from seed (which is an easy process!), expect to see blooms in its second year.

Credit: Kristine Radkovska / Getty Images The pretty blooms of aster daisy, Symphyotrichum, are easy to grow in their natural habitat. Their delicate yet cheerful blooms can be found in a variety of colors, though a lavender purple is a fall-blooming season favorite, particularly thanks to the contrast with its yellow center. They're also popular with pollinators, making them an excellent plant for native gardens. Native Area: North AmericaUSDA Growing Zones: 4-8Height: 4 feet highSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: Pink, purple, blue, white Blue Daisy Credit: photohampster / Getty Images Blue daisy, Felicia amelloides, is one of the daisy varieties that grows into a small, low-maintenance perennial shrub that is covered in flowers. They attract pollinators including bees and butterflies. Blooming all summer long, the blue daisy provides a cool anecdote to the pinks, oranges, and yellows you'll find throughout most gardens.

This cheerful flower smells just like chocolate and fills the air with its delicious aroma as it blooms all summer long. This hardy plant can tolerate extreme conditions, including drought and cold. Native Area: Southwestern United States and MexicoUSDA Growing Zones: 4-9Height: 12 to 15 inches tallSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: Yellow Desert Star Daisy Credit: BruceBlock / Getty Images The darling Desert Star Daisy, Monoptilon bellidiforme, is one of the smallest daisies, yet it's also one of the hardiest.

Native Area: South AfricaUSDA Growing Zones: 9-11Height: 1 to 2 feetSun Exposure: FullFlower Color: Yellow Dahlberg Daisy Credit: Patcharamai Vutipapornkul / Getty Images While Dahlberg daisies, Thymophylla tenuiloba, can be grown as a perennial, they're often grown as an annual due to their short blooming season. These small, spreading plants produce petite flowers that are often no more than 1/2 inch across. They're a lovely plant to fill space throughout borders and in rock gardens, and you don't have to worry about watering them often—they're tolerant of both drought and hot weather.

They have a tissue paper-like quality to them, yet they're so full and abundant that they bring rich, vibrant color to bouquets and floral arrangements alike. They come in a variety of colors that are perfect for adding a pop of color to floral decor, hence their name. They bloom throughout late summer and fall, though florists will keep them in their repertoire all year long.
