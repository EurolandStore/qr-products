  "text": "John's Farms in Plainview is a fantastic local supermarket and one of Long Island's best kept secrets. It is a well-organized store with everything needed for a grocery run, offering a wide variety of top-notch products. It is known for the best fish market for miles and has butchers on site for fresh meats like steak and chicken. There is also plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit choices, with the best selection in the area. Pricing is always better than the competition. One thing to note is that they only accept cash or debit cards, so be sure to plan accordingly. The only issue can be getting a parking spot."
