  "text": "Imagine a world where education automatically adapts to your unique learning style, making every lesson engaging, effective, and perhaps even fun. Imagine how much easier it would be to retain information and understand complex topics when presented to you in a more personable way, almost as if it were designed specifically for you. This is what adaptive learning platforms and adaptive learning tools accomplish. Deepstash Team • 10 minute read We've always struggled with concepts like steep learning curves, or difficulty levels that are rigid, set in stone, that often dissuade you into approaching a subject, learning something new or maybe picking up a new skill. Adaptive learning platforms and apps tap into the idea that difficulty should be adjusted dynamically based on your current progress and performance with the sole scope of making sure you learn at your own pace. Become unstoppable with these Deepstash Collections Adaptive learning is a technique that uses data-driven instruction to adjust lessons in real-time to better suit a particular learner’s strengths and weaknesses. Now, in 2024 with the AI rush we're seeing each major company and service trying to incorporate AI features, which adaptive learning can greatly benefit from. As such, AI aided learning is brought even closer to the ideal scenario, where you'd be able to learn any subject, at your own level of understanding, at your own pace and based on your own affinities and interests. It’s like having an outstanding personal tutor who has the ability to know when you need to learn something, how hard that subject should be for your current progress, how often you should learn based on your behavior and what learning goals and milestones you should have. In other words, adaptive learning tools & algorithms can adjust the pace, content, and lesson difficulty based on how well (or poorly) you are progressing. The main benefits of these AI learning tools and features that aid adaptive learning are that learning curves are eased off, the disparity between the speed and efficiency of different learning styles is made less of a detriment and one can focus on the strengths of its own learning style. Adaptive learning is often accompanied by other educational concepts like content chunking, microlearning, spaced repetition, or gamification, which work very well together to enable goals like better retention, improved engagement, better comprehension, and commitment. On a typical day using an adaptive learning app, you might start with a short quiz to assess your understanding of the previous lesson. Based on your performance, the app will modify the upcoming lessons to focus more on areas where you struggled while skipping over topics you've already mastered. For instance, if you’re learning math and consistently solve algebra problems correctly but struggle with geometry, the adaptive learning software will present more geometry problems and related instructional material. As you progress, the platform continuously tracks your performance, adjusting the difficulty level and providing real-time feedback. In another scenario, an adaptive learning app for language learning might notice you excel in vocabulary but have trouble with grammar. The app will then tailor exercises to reinforce grammar rules, ensuring a balanced learning experience. Overall, adaptive learning platforms ensure that your educational journey is personalized, making learning more efficient and effective by focusing on your unique needs and progress.
