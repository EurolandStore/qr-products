  "title": "New design for Jami on desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows) - News - Jami Forum",
  "text": "Hello everyone and happy new year 2026, We’ve been working on a design refresh of the Jami Qt client, which is the version of Jami used on GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows. The new design is already available for testing on macOS (non-app store beta version) and Flatpak (beta) on GNU/Linux, and should be published on all other beta channels in the next few days. There is still time for us to improve the design and fix remaining issues before the new version is published. This testing period is the best time for the community to provide feedback, report regressions and give your opinion on the new UI. Happy jaming 3 Likes ovari 2 Thank you for sharing the wonderful news with the community. Please visit the following link for the macOS (non-app store beta version) installation instructions. Please visit the following link for the Flatpak (beta) on GNU/Linux installation instructions. Thank you very much for having the Flatpak (beta) on GNU/Linux with the new design and the other beta channels not published, as it has enabled testing the versions side by side. Is it possible to have at least 1 more Flatpak (beta channel) release before publishing on the other beta channels? 2 Likes ovari 3 Should feedback or regressions be linked to the following issue? Thank you 1 Like Yes, thank you very much. 1 Like Woah! It’s fancy! Very modern looking. 2 Likes"
