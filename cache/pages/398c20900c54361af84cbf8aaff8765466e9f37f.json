  "text": "Blood elves - IXTJ Night elves - INTJ don't know where you'd get Es from I agree, I've always felt that the two elf races were clearly Is...they're shown to be quite individualistic and very particular about who they trust and befriend, especially the Blood Elves... IMHO though, the Night Elves are exemplars of the INFX types - they care about nature and balance in the world and they're shown to be sensitive to others feelings and good friends once the initial distrust has been overcome. Other race/class correlations: Alliance races Human - ESTJ, ESTP Dwarf - ESTP, ESFP Gnome - INTP, ENTP Night elf - INFP, INFJ Dreneai - INTJ, INFJ, ENFJ Worgen - I haven't played/seen them yet Horde races Orc - ESTJ, ISTJ Troll - ISTP, INTP Tauren - INFJ, ENFJ Undead - INTJ, ENTJ Blood Elf - ISTP, ISTJ, INTJ (depending on class/character) Goblin - ENTP, ENFP Classes Death Knight - ENTJ, ESTJ Warrior - ESTJ, ESTP, ISTJ Druid - ISFP, INFP Hunter - ISFP, ISFJ, ESFP Mage - INTP, INFP, INFJ Priest - INFJ, ENFJ Shaman - Probably any feeling type Rogue - ISTP, ESTP Warlock - INTJ, ENTP, ENTJ Paladin - ESFJ, ISFJ People can't play a Death Knight if their personality doesn't fit. Most people I've known who are strong Feeling types, not really into evil themes, and/or prefer ranged combat over melee abandon their DK long before reaching Northrend."
