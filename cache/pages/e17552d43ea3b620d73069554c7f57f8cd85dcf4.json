  "text": "We had that big rain on the 2nd and 3rd which destroyed December snow. They change the ski report sometimes after the initial tally. There was a 3 inch day but I didn’t see anything new so I’m not sure if I added that in here. 39” new in December since the resort opened on 12/20. The resort is counting the early snow we had plus the snowfall when they were delayed opening in December. 36° at the bottom and 50° at midway at 5:30 AM this morning. 47° on top."
