  "text": "The GEO Group is comprised of 23,000 employees worldwide that strive each day to provide high-quality services in safe, secure, and humane environments. We range from social workers, educators, security officers, doctors and nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, to clergy, and addiction specialists. Our work for our public-sector partners spans design and development, management and operations for correctional solutions and alternatives to detention through supervision in the community, reentry programming, evidence-based rehabilitation, and post-release reintegration programs. We are especially proud that our Continuum of Care® program is proven to reduce recidivism. Our focus is rehabilitative, not punitive, and our goal is to be the world’s leading provider of evidence-based rehabilitation by helping those men and women entrusted to our care to prepare them for successful reentry into society."
