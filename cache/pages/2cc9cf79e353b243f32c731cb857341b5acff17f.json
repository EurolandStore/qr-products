Customers' Favorites Reisman's Bakery Reviews The cake is amazing, the poppy seed roll is as good or better than my mom's (don't tell her ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½) I buy it at The Fooderie in West Orange NJ. They told me my order would be here on November 27th. Then March 1st. Now March 3rd! Thatâs almost a week! So my âfreshâ, expensive bakery goods will now be old and stale. They blamed their chosen delivery service and did nothing to compensate me for my week old goods. Never again! fresh and delicious!"
