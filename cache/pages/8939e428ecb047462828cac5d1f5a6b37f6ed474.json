Chase ATM or branch Find a Chase ATM or branch near you. Understanding when your payment is processed The \"credited\" date is the effective date of your payment, which determines if your payment is made on time and is used for calculating interest. The \"posted\" date (evening) is when your payment will be displayed online as a transaction in your account activity and applied to your account balance. If you pay at least the minimum amount due between 8 PM and 11:59 PM Eastern time and today’s your due date, don’t worry: Your payment will still be on time. You’ll see a late fee on your account tomorrow, but we’ll reverse it automatically when the payment posts in 1-2 days. Note: Online payments referenced by this table are initiated by signing in and using the chase.com credit card payment option above. Payments made through other websites or other services within chase.com, including Chase Bill Pay, may have different processing times."
