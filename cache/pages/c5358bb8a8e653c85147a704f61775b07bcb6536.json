  "text": "So, Copilot. What exactly is it? This is the question I am fielding literally daily from C-suite folks to IT Admins. Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Microsoft has made their family of Copilot products/features as clear as mud, and they have rebranded one that had a decent name, to just Copilot. Since when did marketing at Microsoft not do marketing? Bing Chat Enterprise = Copilot. Copilot for Microsoft 365 = is a collection of experiences with a variety of invocations inside apps generally known as M365 and appearing under different modalities--all for which there really isn't a good guide to product capabilities. Do not get me started on the lack of documentation. December the documentation was up to 24 pages, by Feb it had increased by a bit but when compared to other products with hundreds of pages of documentation, it falls flat. IT Admins are cranky because there is so very little control and insight on their side compared to [gestures wildly at everything else M365]. Customers are confused, marketing is not clear, apps literally change MID DEMO and rebrand (happened to me last Tuesday--it was amusing but also...not really?) How can this be a solid strategy for a product? Sooooo what do you hate the most about how all this is being rolled out? Are you experiencing the random 'hey where did that go' in M365 apps when Copilot just disappears on a licensed user?"
