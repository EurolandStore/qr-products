  "text": "Oh, dude, changing the line length in Microsoft Word is like changing your mind about what Pizza topping you want. You just gotta go to the \"Layout\" tab, click on \"Margins,\" and then choose your desired line length by adjusting the margin size. It's that easy, like deciding between pepperoni or pineapple on your pizza."
