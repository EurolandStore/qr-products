Mission Status NASA Spacecraft in Orbit NASA Rovers on the Surface Featured Topics Mars Overview Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky — it looks like a bright red point of light. Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers — like NASA's Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter — serve as pathfinders to eventually get astronauts to the surface of the Red Planet. NASA’s Mars Spacecraft Capture Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS Two orbiters and a rover captured images of the interstellar object — from the closest location any of the agency’s… Read the StoryReport: Perseverance Rock Sample Contains 'Potential Biosignatures' A sample collected by NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover from an ancient dry riverbed in Jezero Crater could preserve evidence of ancient microbial life. Taken from a rock named “Cheyava Falls” last year, the sample, called “Sapphire Canyon,” contains potential biosignatures, according to a paper published Sept. 10 in the journal Nature. Read 'NASA Says Mars Rover Discovered Potential Biosignature Last Year'NASA Shares Details of Perseverance Rover Finding Experts discuss the analysis of a rock sampled by NASA's Perseverance Mars rover last year, and the science findings published Wednesday, Sept. 10, in the journal Nature. The sample, called “Sapphire Canyon,” was collected in July 2024 from a set of rocky outcrops on the edges of Neretva Vallis, a river valley carved by water rushing into Jezero Crater long ago. Replay the Sept. 10 news conferenceMeet the Mars Samples: Sapphire Canyon (Sample 25) Meet the 25th Martian sample collected by NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover – “Sapphire Canyon” – a sample taken from a vein-filled rock named “Cheyava Falls.” The arrowhead-shaped rock contains compelling features that may help answer whether Mars was home to microscopic life in the distant past. Learn More About 'Sapphire Canyon'How We Explore Mars NASA has five active missions at the Red Planet and a future mission under study. MARS SAMPLE RETURN | Future Mission NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) are planning ways to bring the first samples of Mars material back to Earth for detailed study. Launch: TBD PERSEVERANCE MARS ROVER | Active Mission The Mars 2020 mission Perseverance rover is the first step of a proposed roundtrip journey to return Mars samples to Earth. Launch: July 30, 2020 | 11:50 UTC Mars Landing: Feb. 18, 2021 | 20:55 UTC CURIOSITY MARS ROVER | Active Mission Curiosity is investigating Mars to determine whether the Red Planet was ever habitable to microbial life. Launch: Nov. 26, 2011 | 15:02 UTC Mars Landing: Aug. 6, 2012 | 05:32 UTC MAVEN | Active Mission The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission is the first mission devoted to understanding the Martian upper atmosphere. Launch: Nov. 18. 2013 | 18:28 UTC Mars Arrival: Sept. 22, 2014 | 02:24 UTC MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER | Active Mission Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter searches for evidence that water persisted on the surface of Mars for a long period of time. Launch: Aug. 12, 2005 Mars Arrival: Mar. 10, 2006 MARS ODYSSEY | Active Mission Mars Odyssey mission created the first global map of chemical elements and minerals that make up the Martian surface. Launch: April 7, 2001 | 15:02:22 UTC Mars Arrival: Oct. 24, 2001 NASA Resumes Efforts to Reestablish Contact With MAVEN As spacecraft and rovers at Mars emerge from solar conjunction — a period when the Red Planet and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun and contact with Mars missions isn’t possible — NASA has resumed efforts to recontact its MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft using NASA’s Deep Space Network and the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Observatory. The spacecraft was last heard from on Dec. 6. Read the Latest MAVEN NewsNASA Launches Twin Satellites to Investigate Mars' Space Weather NASA's Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, which launched Nov. 13, will study Mars' real-time response to the solar wind, helping us better understand Mars' climate history — from a planet that hosted rivers, lakes, and floods billions of years ago, to the cold, dry desert we see on the surface today. The twin, refrigerator-sized orbiters are scheduled to arrive at Mars in September 2027, and begin their science mission the following spring. Learn More About the ESCAPADE MissionWhy Do We Go? Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to explore the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

Mars remains our horizon goal for human exploration because it is one of the only other places we know in the solar system where life may have existed. What we learn about the Red Planet will tell us more about our Earth’s past and future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our home planet.
