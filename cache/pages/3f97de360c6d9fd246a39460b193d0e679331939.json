  "text": "Here's how much snow has already fallen in Salina - Snowfall totals in Salina were lower than initially forecasted by the National Weather Service. - Despite less snow, hazardous driving conditions and potential infrastructure disruptions were still expected. - Arctic air brought dangerously cold temperatures and windchills as low as -19 degrees to the region. Snow continued to fall Saturday, but totals in Salina are lower than expected for the city's first major winter weather event. The National Weather Service in Wichita originally forecasted 6 to 8 inches of total snowfall by Jan. 25 in Salina. Not as much snow fell overnight and by 5:30 a.m. on Jan. 24, that expected snowfall total was updated, with 4 to 6 inches the new forecast. That expectation was met about an hour later, with an official NWS report of 5 inches measured in the city. According to the NWS forecast, the rest of the day on Jan. 24 could still see around 1 to 3 inches of added snowfall. Even with lesser amounts of total accumulation than expected, the NWS said that there will still be moderate impacts including hazardous driving conditions and closures and disruptions to infrastructure possible. Bitter cold still a danger for region While snowfall didn't quite reach expectations, arctic air did bring plummeting temperatures to the area. Many people awoke on Jan. 24 in Salina to actual temperatures at zero degrees or lower, with windchills dropping as low as -19. That bitter cold was expected to continue, with windchills forecast to remain below zero until at least the morning of Jan. 26."
