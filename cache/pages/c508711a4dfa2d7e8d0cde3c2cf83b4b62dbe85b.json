  "text": "What does /j or /s on Twitter mean? I've seen it a bunch on Twitter, and just now on reddit. A couple minecraft stan accounts (don't judge me) I see use them a lot(like /j, /c, /s, I've seen /pos once) and I tried searching but still have no clue. I was replied to once with \" /j????\", does that mean anything at all? I don't wanna post any example or link to some random persons twitter, cause that's weird I think Edit: I found a list of what a lot of them were. They're called tone indicators -"
