Stick is irregular: the simple past and past participle are formed as follows: stick - stuck - stuck. There is no \"stucked\". This kind of mistake is often made by English children. I imagine it is also common for people learning English as a second language. Any good dictionary, for example the Cambridge Dictionary, will tell you the correct forms for the simple past and the past participle."
