  "text": "Danilo seals loan move from Rangers to NEC Nijmegen - Published Rangers have confirmed Brazilian striker Danilo has left to join NEC Nijmegen on loan for the rest of the season. The deal includes an option for NEC, who are currently third in the Eredivisie, to buy the 26-year-old. Danilo moved to Ibrox from Feyenoord in the summer of 2023, signing a five-year deal, but was troubled by injuries and never nailed down a regular starting place. The 26-year-old was behind Youssef Chermiti and Bojan Miovski in the pecking order at Rangers, and the deadline-day signing of Ryan Naderi from Hansa Rostock meant the club were happy for him to move on. Danilo has scored 16 goals in 76 games for Rangers and won the League Cup with the club in 2024. Speaking on Tuesday morning, head coach Danny Rohl had suggested the player's departure was imminent and said he was happy with the January transfer business as he reshaped his squad for the title run-in. In addition to Naderi, the club completed deals to take winger Andreas Skov Olsen on loan, as well as sign midfielder Tochi Chukuwani and left-back Tuur Rommens on permanent deals."
