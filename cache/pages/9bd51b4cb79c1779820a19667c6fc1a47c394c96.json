  "text": "Where can I watch Love by Gaspar Noe 2015 movie Where to watch Love by Gaspar Noe? Netflix removed it for some reason... so now I can’t watch it! I think it was removed due to the grotesque nature of the movie. Anyways, I’ve looked everywhere and can’t seem to find it on prime video, Google play, or any other streaming service. I am wondering if there’s a site I can watch it on with decent resolution and preferably legally but I guess I don’t care about the legality much as long as the image quality is good. Any ideas?"
