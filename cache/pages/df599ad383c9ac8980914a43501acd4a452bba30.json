This stand has a working height range from a minimum of 43\" (109 cm) to a maximum of 68.5\" (174 cm). Stability is the keyword for this stand. It is not the type of stand that you throw over your shoulder and carry around! This stand weighs approximately 205 lbs. (93 kg). Learn more about this RS-230 stand here. Portable Metrology Stand (MAS 2000TA) The M-Series portable metrology stands have been requested both by customers and other metrology instrument OEMs. With their input, Brunson has designed this instrument stand for functionality and portability. This collapsible, tripod-type stand will work with the KinAiry laser tracker field test solution. This stand features aluminum double upper legs, which span from the shoulder pivots to the \"knee\" of the stand. This stand comes with an adjustable column, also called the \"intermediate tube.\" The adjustable mount employs a handwheel-driven worm gear for up-and-down adjustment of the column. The collar may then be clamped to avoid any inadvertent movement."
