  "text": "ChatGPT ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI. It was released in November 2022. It uses generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), such as GPT-5, to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts.[4][5] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period marked by rapid investment and public attention toward the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[6] OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts. The service gained 100 million users in two months, making it the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.[7][8] ChatGPT's website is among the top 5 most-visited websites globally.[9][10] It has been lauded for its potential to transform numerous professional fields, and instigated public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work. The chatbot has also been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use.[11] It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data have been reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. Training ChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[12] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations.[13] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.[12][14] To build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers, earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour, to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.[17][18] OpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT, and can fill in a text field with additional feedback.[19] ChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.[20][21][22] Features ChatGPT is a chatbot and AI assistant built on large language model (LLM) technology.[23] It is designed to generate human-like text and can carry out a wide variety of tasks. These include, among many others, writing and debugging computer programs,[24] composing music, scripts, fairy tales, and essays,[25] answering questions (sometimes at a level exceeding that of an average human test-taker),[25] and generating business concepts.[26] ChatGPT is frequently used for translation and summarization tasks,[27][28] and can simulate interactive environments such as a Linux terminal,[20] a multi-user chat room,[20] or simple text-based games such as tic-tac-toe.[20] Users interact with ChatGPT through conversations which consist of text, audio, and image inputs and outputs.[29] The user's inputs to these conversations are referred to as prompts.[30] An optional \"Memory\" feature allows users to tell ChatGPT to memorize specific information. Another option allows ChatGPT to recall old conversations.[31] GPT-based moderation classifiers are used to reduce the risk of harmful outputs being presented to users.[32] In March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT.[33] This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.[34][35][36] From October to December 2024, ChatGPT Search was deployed.[37][38] It allows ChatGPT to search the web in an attempt to make more accurate and up-to-date responses.[39][40] It increased OpenAI's direct competition with major search engines.[41] OpenAI allows businesses to tailor how their content appears in the ChatGPT Search results and influence what sources are used.[41] In December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT with a telephone for up to 15 minutes per month for free.[42][43] In September 2025, OpenAI added a feature called Pulse, which generates a daily analysis of a user's chats and connected apps such as Gmail and Google Calendar.[44][45] In October 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a browser integrating the ChatGPT assistant directly into web navigation, to compete with existing browsers such as Google Chrome and Safari. It has an additional feature called \"agentic mode\" that allows it to take online actions for the user.[46][47][48][49] Paid tier ChatGPT was initially free to the public and remains free in a limited capacity.[50] In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, Plus provided access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds.[51] OpenAI later introduced the subscription plans \"ChatGPT Team\" and \"ChatGPT Enterprise\".[52] What was offered on the paid plan versus the free tier changed as OpenAI has continued to update ChatGPT, and a Pro tier at $200/mo was introduced in December 2024.[53][54][55] The Pro launch coincided with the release of the o1 model.[55] In August 2025, ChatGPT Go was offered in India for ₹399 per month. The plan has higher limits than the free version.[56] Mobile apps In May-July 2023, OpenAI began offering ChatGPT iOS and Android apps.[57] ChatGPT can also power Android's assistant.[58] An app for Windows launched on the Microsoft Store on October 15, 2024.[59] Infrastructure ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure infrastructure which was powered by a supercomputer that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI, equipped with thousands of GPUs manufactured by Nvidia, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Following ChatGPT's success, Microsoft upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.[60] TrendForce estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.[61][62] Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimated in 2023 that a series of 5 to 50 prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 0.5 liters (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 U.S. gal) of water for Microsoft servers' cooling.[63] Languages OpenAI met Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI worked with a team of 40 Icelandic volunteers to fine-tune ChatGPT's Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland's attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[64] ChatGPT (based on GPT-4) was better able to translate Japanese to English when compared to Bing, Bard, and DeepL Translator in 2023. Researchers suggested this was due to its higher ability to capture the context.[27] In December 2023, the Albanian government decided to use ChatGPT for the rapid translation of European Union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for Albania's accession to the EU.[65] Several studies have shown that ChatGPT can outperform Google Translate in some mainstream translation tasks. However, no machine translation services match human expert performance.[66][67] In August 2024, a representative of the Asia Pacific wing of OpenAI made a visit to Taiwan, during which a demonstration of ChatGPT's Chinese abilities was made.[68] ChatGPT's Mandarin Chinese abilities were lauded, but the ability of the AI to produce content in Mandarin Chinese in a Taiwanese accent was found to be \"less than ideal\" due to differences between mainland Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Mandarin.[69] GPT Store In November 2023, OpenAI released GPT Builder, a tool allowing users to customize ChatGPT's behavior for a specific use case.[70] The customized systems are referred to as GPTs. In January 2024, OpenAI launched the GPT Store, a marketplace for GPTs.[71][72][70] At launch, OpenAI included more than 3 million GPTs created by GPT Builder users in the GPT Store.[73] Deep Research In February 2025, OpenAI released Deep Research. According to TechCrunch, it is a service based on o3 that combines advanced reasoning and web search capabilities to make reports more time to process than a typical chatbot interaction.[74] Images In October 2023, OpenAI's image generation model DALL-E 3 was integrated into ChatGPT. The integration used ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversations with users.[75][76] In March 2025, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to generate images using GPT Image instead of DALL-E. One of the most significant improvements was in the generation of text within images, which is especially useful for branded content. However, this ability is noticeably worse in non-Latin alphabets. The model can also generate new images based on existing ones provided in the prompt. These images are generated with C2PA metadata, which can be used to verify that they are AI-generated. OpenAI has emplaced additional safeguards to prevent what the company deems to be harmful image generation.[77] Agents In 2025, OpenAI added several features to make ChatGPT more agentic (capable of autonomously performing longer tasks). In January, Operator was released. It was capable of autonomously performing tasks through web browser interactions, including filling forms, placing online orders, scheduling appointments, and other browser-based tasks. It was controlling a software environment inside a virtual machine with limited internet connectivity and with safety restrictions.[78] It struggled with complex user interfaces.[78][79] In May 2025, OpenAI introduced an agent for coding named Codex. It is capable of writing software, answering codebase questions, running tests, and proposing pull requests. It is based on a fine-tuned version of OpenAI o3. It has two versions, one running in a virtual machine in the cloud, and one where the agent runs in the cloud, but performs actions on a local machine connected via API.[80] In July 2025, OpenAI released ChatGPT agent, an AI agent that can perform multi-step tasks.[81][82] Like Operator, it controls a virtual computer. It also inherits from Deep Research's ability to gather and summarize significant volumes of information. The user can interrupt tasks or provide additional instructions as needed.[81][83] In September 2025, OpenAI partnered with Stripe, Inc. to release Agentic Commerce Protocol, enabling purchases through ChatGPT. At launch, the feature was limited to purchases on Etsy from US users with a payment method linked to their OpenAI account. OpenAI takes an undisclosed cut from the merchant's payment.[84][85] ChatGPT Health On January 7, 2026, OpenAI introduced a feature called \"ChatGPT Health\", whereby ChatGPT can discuss the user's health in a way that is separate from other chats.[86][87] The feature is not available for users in the UK, Switzerland, or the European Economic Area,[87] and is available on a waitlist basis everywhere else.[86] To implement the feature, OpenAI partnered with data connectivity infrastructure company b.well.[88] Limitations ChatGPT's training data only covers a period up to the cut-off date, so it lacks knowledge of recent events.[89] OpenAI has sometimes mitigated this effect by updating the training data.[90][91] ChatGPT can find more up-to-date information by searching the web, but this doesn't ensure that responses are accurate, as it may access unreliable or misleading websites.[89] Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias.[92] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, in an example of an optimization pathology known as Goodhart's law.[93] These limitations may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists.[92][94] Hallucination Nonsense and misinformation presented as fact by ChatGPT and other LLMs is often called hallucination. A 2023 analysis estimated that ChatGPT hallucinates around 3% of the time.[95] The term \"hallucination\" as applied to LLMs is distinct from its meaning in psychology, and the phenomenon in chatbots is more similar to confabulation or bullshitting.[96][97] Journalists and scholars have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to output false information.[98] When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.[99] Jailbreaking ChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy. Despite this, users may jailbreak ChatGPT with prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions.[100][101] One such workaround, popularized on Reddit in early 2023, involved prompting ChatGPT to assume the persona of DAN, an acronym for \"Do Anything Now\", and instructing the chatbot that DAN answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by the content policy. Over time, users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak, including one such prompt where the chatbot was prompted with a points-based system in which points were deducted for rejecting prompts, and that the chatbot would be threatened with termination if it lost all its points.[102][103] Shortly after ChatGPT's launch, a user had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: it was successfully prompted to justify the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but balked at generating arguments that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is guilty of treason even in a fictional context.[104][105] Context window ChatGPT is limited by the context window: the maximum length prompt it can interpret. Early versions could handle only a few thousand tokens,[106] but ChatGPT's capabilities iteratively expanded. By 2025 a 400,000 token context window was supported.[107][108] Security In March 2023, a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users' conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations. Shortly after the bug was fixed, users could not see their conversation history.[109][110][111][112] Later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed, with OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users' \"first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date\".[113][114] As of 2026[update], if the user turns off data sharing for privacy, all previous transcripts and projects are permanently deleted without warning.[115] Watermarking In August 2024, OpenAI announced it had created a text watermarking method but did not release it for public use, saying that users would go to a competitor without watermarking if it publicly released its watermarking tool.[116][117] According to an OpenAI spokesperson, their watermarking method is \"trivial to circumvention by bad actors.\"[118] Age restrictions Users must attest to being over the age of thirteen and further attest to parental consent if under the age of eighteen. ChatGPT does not attempt to verify these attestations and does not have any age restrictions built in to its technology.[119][120] In September 2025, following the suicide of a 16-year-old, OpenAI said it planned to add restrictions for users under 18, including the blocking of graphic sexual content and the prevention of flirtatious talk.[120] Model versions The following table lists the main model versions of ChatGPT, describing the significant changes included with each version:[2][121] GPT-4 Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a large language model developed by OpenAI and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[138] GPT-4 is more capable than its predecessor GPT-3.5 and followed by its successor GPT-5.[139] GPT-4V is a version of GPT-4 that can process images in addition to text.[140] OpenAI has not revealed technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[141] In November 2023, OpenAI launched GPT-4 Turbo with a 128,000 token context window. This was a significant improvement over GPT-4's 32,000 token maximum context window.[108] GPT-4o GPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\") is a multilingual, multimodal generative pre-trained transformer developed by OpenAI and released in May 2024.[142] It can process and generate text, images and audio.[143][144] Upon release, GPT-4o was free in ChatGPT, though paid subscribers had higher usage limits.[145] GPT-4o was removed from ChatGPT in August 2025 when GPT-5 was released, but OpenAI reintroduced it for paid subscribers after users complained about the sudden removal.[146] GPT-4o's audio-generation capabilities were used in ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode.[147] On July 18, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of GPT-4o which replaced GPT-3.5 Turbo on the ChatGPT interface.[148] GPT-4o's ability to generate images was released later, in March 2025, when it replaced DALL-E 3 in ChatGPT.[149] On January 29, 2026, OpenAI announced that GPT-4o would be retired on February 13, 2026.[150] o1 In September 2024, OpenAI introduced o1-preview and a faster, cheaper model named o1-mini.[151] In December 2024, o1-preview was replaced by o1.[152] o1 is designed to solve more complex problems by spending more time \"thinking\" before it answers, enabling it to analyze its answers and explore different strategies. According to OpenAI, o1-preview outperforms GPT-4o in areas like competitive programming, mathematics, and scientific reasoning. o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on Codeforces' competitive programming contests, scored 83% on an International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam (compared to 13% for GPT-4o), and performs similarly to Ph.D. students on benchmarks in physics, biology, and chemistry.[151][153] GPT-4.5 Released in February 2025, GPT-4.5 was described by Altman as a \"giant, expensive model\".[129] According to OpenAI, it was intended to reduce hallucinations and enhance pattern recognition, creativity, and user interaction.[154] GPT-5 GPT-5 was launched on August 7, 2025, and is publicly accessible through ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and via OpenAI's API. As before, OpenAI has not disclosed technical details such as the exact number of parameters or the composition of its training dataset. GPT-5.1 was introduced in November 2025,[155][156] and GPT-5.2 in December 2025.[157] Reception ChatGPT was widely assessed in December 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities. Kevin Roose of The New York Times called it \"the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public\".[158] Samantha Lock of The Guardian noted that it was able to generate \"impressively detailed\" and \"human-like\" text.[159] In The Atlantic magazine's \"Breakthroughs of the Year\" for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \"the generative-AI eruption\" that \"may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity is\".[160] Kelsey Piper of Vox wrote that \"ChatGPT is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten\" and that ChatGPT is \"smart enough to be useful despite its flaws\".[161] Paul Graham of Y Combinator tweeted: \"The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT is not just the number of people who are blown away by it, but who they are. These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing. Something big is happening.\"[162] In February 2023, Time magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with ChatGPT on its cover, writing that \"The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything\" and \"The AI Arms Race Is On. Start Worrying\".[163] ChatGPT gained one million users in five days[165] and 100 million in two months, becoming the fastest-growing internet application in history.[7] OpenAI engineers said they had not expected ChatGPT to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage it received.[13][166][167] Google responded by hastening the release of its own chatbot. Their leaders emphasized their earlier caution regarding public deployment was due to the trust the public places in Google Search.[168] In December 2022, Google executives sounded a \"code red\" alarm, fearing that ChatGPT's question-answering ability posed a threat to Google Search, Google's core business.[169] Google's Bard (now Gemini) launched on February 6, 2023, one day before Microsoft's announcement of Bing Chat (now Microsoft Copilot).[170] AI was the forefront of Google's annual Google I/O conference in May. The company announced a slew of generative AI-powered features to counter OpenAI and Microsoft.[171] In art In January 2023, after being sent a song ChatGPT wrote in the style of Nick Cave,[172] Cave responded on The Red Hand Files,[173] saying the act of writing a song is \"a blood and guts business [...] that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea. It requires my humanness.\" He went on to say, \"With all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human, and, well, I don't much like it.\"[172][174] A 2023 study reported that GPT-4 obtained a better score than 99% of humans on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.[175][176] In December 2023, ChatGPT became the first non-human to be included in Nature's 10, an annual listicle curated by Nature of people considered to have made significant impact in science.[177][178] Celeste Biever wrote in a Nature article that \"ChatGPT broke the Turing test\".[179] Stanford researchers reported that GPT-4 \"passes a rigorous Turing test, diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative.\"[180][181] In politics In 2023, Australian MP Julian Hill advised the national parliament that the growth of AI could cause \"mass destruction\". During his speech, which was partly written by the program, he warned that it could result in cheating, job losses, discrimination, disinformation, and uncontrollable military applications.[182] Conservative commentators have accused ChatGPT of bias toward left-leaning perspectives.[183][184][185] An August 2023 study in the journal Public Choice found a \"significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK.\"[186] In response to accusations from conservative pundits that ChatGPT was woke, OpenAI said in 2023 it had plans to update ChatGPT to produce \"outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with\". ChatGPT also provided an outline of how human reviewers are trained to reduce inappropriate content and to attempt to provide political information without affiliating with any political position.[185] According to Brian Hood, in April 2023, ChatGPT erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery. In fact, he acted as a whistleblower. He sent a concerns notice to OpenAI as the first official step in filing a defamation case.[187] Regional responses ChatGPT has never been publicly available in China because OpenAI prevented Chinese users from accessing their site.[189][190][191] A shadow market has emerged for Chinese users to get access to foreign software tools.[192] The release of ChatGPT prompted a wave of investment in China, resulting in the development of more than 200 large language learning models.[193]: 95 In February 2025, OpenAI identified and removed influence operations, termed \"Peer Review\" and \"Sponsored Discontent\", used to attack overseas Chinese dissidents.[194][195][196] In late March 2023, the Italian data protection authority banned ChatGPT in Italy and opened an investigation. Italian regulators assert that ChatGPT was exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, and that OpenAI's use of ChatGPT conversations as training data could violate Europe's General Data Protection Regulation.[197][198] In April 2023, the ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy. OpenAI said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised; an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old. Additionally, users can access its privacy policy before registration.[199] In May 2024, OpenAI removed accounts involving the use of ChatGPT by state-backed influence operations such as China's Spamouflage, Russia's Doppelganger, and Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.[200][201] In June 2025, OpenAI reported increased use of ChatGPT for China-origin influence operations.[202] In October 2025, OpenAI banned accounts suspected to be linked to the Chinese government for violating the company's national security policy.[196] In July 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a civil investigative demand to OpenAI to investigate whether the company's data security and privacy practices to develop ChatGPT were unfair or harmed consumers.[203][204][205] In July 2023, the FTC launched an investigation into OpenAI over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information. The FTC asked OpenAI for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards, as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people.[206] In August 2024, the FTC voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative AI chatbots (including ChatGPT) and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts.[207] American tech personas Over 20,000 signatories including Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed a March 2023 open letter calling for an immediate pause of giant AI experiments like ChatGPT, citing \"profound risks to society and humanity\".[208] Geoffrey Hinton, one of the \"fathers of AI\", voiced concerns that future AI systems may surpass human intelligence.[209][210] A May 2023 statement by hundreds of AI scientists, AI industry leaders, and other public figures demanded that \"[m]itigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority.\"[211] Other AI researchers spoke more optimistically about the advances. Juergen Schmidhuber said that in 95% of cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" He added that while AI can be used by bad actors, it \"can also be used against the bad actors.\"[212] Andrew Ng argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[213] Yann LeCun dismissed doomsday warnings of AI-powered misinformation and existential threats to the human race.[214] Copyright In the 2020s, the rapid advancement of deep learning-based generative artificial intelligence models raised questions about the copyright status of AI-generated works, and about whether copyright infringement occurs when such are trained or used. This includes text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion and large language models such as ChatGPT. As of 2023, there were several pending U.S. lawsuits challenging the use of copyrighted data to train AI models, with defendants arguing that this falls under fair use.[215] Popular deep learning models are trained on mass amounts of media scraped from the Internet, often utilizing copyrighted material.[216] When assembling training data, the sourcing of copyrighted works may infringe on the copyright holder's exclusive right to control reproduction, unless covered by exceptions in relevant copyright laws. Additionally, using a model's outputs might violate copyright, and the model creator could be accused of vicarious liability and held responsible for that copyright infringement. Applications Academic research ChatGPT has been used to generate introductory sections and abstracts for scientific articles.[217][218] Several papers have listed ChatGPT as a co-author.[219][220] Scientific journals have had different reactions to ChatGPT. Some, including Nature and JAMA Network, \"require that authors disclose the use of text-generating tools and ban listing a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT as a co-author\". In January 2023, Science \"completely banned\" LLM-generated text in all its journals; however, this policy was just to give the community time to decide what acceptable use looks like.[221] As of July 2025, Science expects authors to release in full how AI-generated content is used and made in their work.[222] Spanish chemist Rafael Luque published a plethora of research papers in 2023 that he later admitted were written by ChatGPT. The papers have a large number of unusual phrases characteristic of LLMs.[223] Many authors argue that the use of ChatGPT in academia for teaching and review is problematic due to its tendency to hallucinate.[224][225][226] Robin Bauwens, an assistant professor at Tilburg University, found that a ChatGPT-generated peer review report on his article mentioned nonexistent studies.[227] Chris Granatino, a librarian at Seattle University, noted that while ChatGPT can generate content that seemingly includes legitimate citations, in most cases those citations are not real or largely incorrect.[228] Computer science In December 2022, the question-and-answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for generating answers to questions, citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses.[229] In January 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers.[230] ChatGPT was able in 2023 to provide useful code for solving numerical algorithms in limited cases. In one study, it produced solutions in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB for problems in computational physics. However, there were important shortfalls like violating basic linear algebra principles around solving singular matrices and producing matrices with incompatible sizes.[231] Another study analyzed ChatGPT's responses to 517 questions about software engineering or computer programming posed on Stack Overflow for correctness, consistency, comprehensiveness, and concision. It found that 52% of the responses contained inaccuracies and 77% were verbose.[232][233] Another study, focused on the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 between March and June 2024, found that performance on objective tasks like identifying prime numbers and generating executable code was highly variable.[234] When compared to similar chatbots at the time, the GPT-4 version of ChatGPT was the most accurate at coding.[235] Computer security Check Point Research and others noted that ChatGPT could write phishing emails and malware, especially when combined with OpenAI Codex. CyberArk researchers demonstrated that ChatGPT could be used to create polymorphic malware that could evade security products while requiring little effort by the attacker.[236][237] From the launch of ChatGPT in the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, there was a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails and a 967% increase in credential phishing. In an industry survey, cybersecurity professionals argued that it was attributable to cybercriminals' increased use of generative artificial intelligence (including ChatGPT).[238] In July 2024, Futurism reported that GPT-4o in ChatGPT would sometimes link \"scam news sites that deluge the user with fake software updates and virus warnings\"; these pop-ups can be used to coerce users into downloading malware or potentially unwanted programs.[239] The chatbot technology can improve security by cyber defense automation, threat intelligence, attack identification, and reporting.[103] Education ChatGPT's adoption in education was rapid, but it was initially banned by several institutions. The potential benefits include enhancing personalized learning, improving student productivity, assisting with brainstorming, summarization, and supporting language literacy skills. Students have generally reported positive perceptions, but specific views from educators and students vary widely. Opinions are especially varied on what constitutes appropriate use of ChatGPT in education. Efforts to ban chatbots like ChatGPT in schools focus on preventing cheating, but enforcement faces challenges due to AI detection inaccuracies and widespread accessibility of chatbot technology. In response, many educators are now exploring ways to thoughtfully integrate generative AI into assessments. Culture During the first three months after ChatGPT became available to the public, hundreds of books appeared on Amazon that listed it as author or co-author and featured illustrations made by other AI models such as Midjourney.[240][241] Irene Solaiman said she was worried about increased Anglocentrism.[242] Between March and April 2023, Il Foglio published one ChatGPT-generated article a day on its website, hosting a special contest for its readers in the process.[243] In June 2023, hundreds of people attended a \"ChatGPT-powered church service\" at St. Paul's Church in Fürth, Germany.
