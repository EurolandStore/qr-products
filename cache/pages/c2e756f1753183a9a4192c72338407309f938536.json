  "text": "Leverock's Great Seafood $$ â¢ Seafood, Burgers, Vegetarian Hours: 840 Pasadena Ave S, St. Petersburg (727) 367-4588 About Leverock's Great Seafood Leverock's Great Seafood is a restaurant known for its excellent seafood, offering preparation options of fried, broiled, and grilled for most of its extremely fresh dishes. They also serve tasty burgers, which is a pleasant surprise for those looking for non-seafood options. The restaurant has plenty of free parking and is wheelchair accessible. While the service can be hit or miss, it is generally pretty good, with some waitstaff receiving praise for their exceptional service. Customers have enjoyed meals featuring $29.99 snow crab legs, which come with a choice of two sides. The ambiance is nice, clean, and bright, making it a favorite seafood spot by the beach. However, there have been instances where refilling drinks and providing additional bread or requested menu items could be improved. The raw oysters are highly recommended for their size and price, and the house salad dressing, creamy garlic, is also a must-try. Customers' Favorites Leverock's Great Seafood Reviews Wow what a great meal we had tonight. The hostess Donna and wait staff were great. Food was off the hook. Too pricey for the amount of portion of food . Salmon de Rico & Lobster Bisque was amazing. Other plates in our party- grilled grouper, swordfish all equally amazing. Howard was awesome!"
