Ordered the veal special and got the special price $89.00 Swordfish on a bed of spinach for $52 another special price Front desk was very rude which was never like that. They have become over priced and not customer friendly. We will not return“ Customers` Favorites “Great food, friendly and knowledgeable staff!! Gluten free selection to keep my wife happily fed also which is sometimes hard!!!“ Customers` Favorites “We are “regulars” at the 89 which means we dine there at least once or twice a week! The food, the severs, the bartenders and the owners are all amazing!! They know “who gets” without asking. They space out courses perfectly, yet they are there when you need them. They never make you feel rushed but check periodically to see if you need anything! We have never had a disappointing meal and we have tried most everything on the menu as well as the weekly specials! From the house made soups to the fresh pastas, entrees and amazing desserts you cannot go wrong. If you haven’t been there and are looking for an outstanding dining experience try 89!! It won’t disappoint!“ Customers` Favorites “One of the few places in the area where I can eat my favorites Italian dishes that taste like in my hometown in northern Italy. And great staff!“ Customers` Favorites “🍾🍸 🦪 Great Food & Cocktails!“ Customers` Favorites “I absolutely love Carbones, the best veal parm ever and shrimp cocktail is yummy 😋 I make sure I go there every Thursday night the bartender is my favorite. Great place for dinner.“ Customers` Favorites “We are regular visitors to Café Assisi, because every visit is excellent, in every way. The food is delicious - tonight we had chicken sorrentino and a shrimp special and enjoyed every bite. Our cocktails were perfect too, and one of our favorite servers, Sylvia, knew just what we would want before we even ordered. It’s nice to visit a restaurant where the quality and service are both above and beyond, every time. Yum.“ Customers` Favorites “Our first time there and it was really good. We will definitely be returning. Great prices and equally fantastic food.“ Customers` Favorites “We had a great dining experience here & loved the food and service so much that we ended up having our rehearsal dinner here!

We highly recommend and will be back for lunch or dinner 🙂“ Customers` Favorites “The frozen meatballs were reheated to perfection, finally some authentic Italian in Wrentham 🥰“ Customers` Favorites “just had one of the best dinners I have had in a long time..the server was (Evan) superb..the food (veal parm) was outstanding..the salad is always great..I really appreciate great Italian food and this was wonderful..“ “you took all the Italian food that made you what you were, a great Italian restaurant. Now you are just another mediocre restaurant with hummus and meh food and $$$$$ Bad choice. Where is the gnocchi??? and everyone has veal and chicken parmesan... not impressed“ Customers` Favorites “been going to Wrentham house for years, best pizza in town“ “I am a frequent customer of this location, eat 2-3 days a week. used to love eating amato's as a kid best place to go to relive my childhood. Do have a problem with the young guy that works there twice now whenever he has had to make my sandwiches he has messed up. Refuse to order through doordash anymore and will only go in the store and order so I can watch him make my sandwiches. Not the sound rude but it's really not that hard to read Black ink on white paper on how to make a sandwich especially since I order the same thing every time I go in made the same way“ Customers` Favorites “Got there large cheese for $6 on my way home today. Wow! Great deal for sure.“ Customers` Favorites “I am the executive director for Bethany House Ministries. Every year Primavera caters our holiday parties for our community, our yearly barbecue and volunteer appreciation luncheon. The food has always been phenomenal, the service exemplary, and the atmosphere absolutely beautiful! A special thank you to Briana who saved the day when we needed a venue quickly because another restaurant canceled us a few days before our January event. She was so understanding and helpful in planning the menu. Sandra our server was amazing…thank you all for everything! Wish I could give you more than 5 stars!!!! Happy New year to the great staff and awesome cooks!!!“ Customers` Favorites “Just did a wedding celebration there on Oct 5th, 2025. Have to make some comments. Facility was Immaculate. Staff was more 6 star than 5. Food was great, but since I was working the stage as DJ, I had mine to go. Packaged well. Large dance floor, and acoustics of the room worked very well. When you perform all over New England, you have to tell it like it is.“ Customers` Favorites “AMAZING FOOD! And great staff!“ Customers` Favorites “Quaint little place that feels authentic and coupled with fantastic service. The owner who works the bakery is very sweet and accommodates your requests. Bakery items are so tasty and you will come back for more. The display of flatbreads are extraordinary as they are lined up for your viewing. A must for breads and tasty treats. The custard filled bombolone is the best (and my favorite).“ Customers` Favorites “As soon as I moved to the area I tried out all the pizza in the area.This was the winner by far. The salad's are huge and delicious pretty much every order gives you a lot of food. And their prices are very fair unlike a lot of places. Also the owners are extremely sincere great people another thing you don't see a lot of nowadays. All around experience definitely gets five stars.“ Customers` Favorites “A very authentic and family friendly Italian Old fashioned store the owners and the staff are are all family , my Dad and I go there every time we're in Milford. We're OG Gumba's as it gets, and we're never disappointed? try the De Parma Sub it's just short of a trip to Italy, but try anything even there pie is a mouth full of Amore'Grazzi Amico Meie,Jimmy and Banjo PadulaFranklin, MA“ Customers` Favorites “Been stopping by here the last few months since I discovered this gem. Ordered catering for family Easter get together for 14 and could have easily fed 25! Everything was delicious, fresh, and they helped me carry it out to my car. Five stars all around and Thank you, Luca’s!“ Customers` Favorites “The food was just as I remembered“ Customers` Favorites “Wheeeeere to begin! A cute little establishment in a little plaza. Upon entering the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The menu is bright and bold so there is not trouble reading it. Came in with my husband before we got ice cream to grab some buffalo wings. Sooooooooo glad I did! Them suckers were so dang good make you wanna smack ya mama! I’m known for my reviews taking a bite and this one won’t be different. We drove 45 minutes for some ice cream and ended up finding a little piece of BUFFALO HEAVEN“ Customers` Favorites “The pizza is amazing!! Besides that I took my 79 yr old father and you can stay and eat. It’s handicap accessible. Bubba’s pizza is out of this world and his staff is so friendly and courteous. I recommend this place to kids and adults of all ages!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️“ Customers` Favorites “My son and I stopped here after his game. We only came chose this one, as it looked empty and tge plan was to get going as quickly as possible. Did we make the right decision. This was the beat pizza we had since moving ro MA 4 years ago. The crust was thin and crispy. The sauce was just sweet enough, and the cheese was perfect! Our only issue, us that this is 25 mins from our house. We will now have to drive 5 towns away to get the best pizza in MA. But is it worth it? YES!!!“ Customers` Favorites “We had our first Team meal here during a recent tournament for our 18U hockey team and their families. Management and staff did a wonderful job hosting us on short notice and the service was phenomenal. Kudos to the fine folks at The Chateau, helped create an amazing afternoon and memory for our group. 10/10 would recommend, the chicken parm is elite.“ Customers` Favorites “We went with friends to listen to Daniel Chauvin play his music and say farewell to a couple who are moving away. The music was awesome, the food was very good, but it was a bit noisy as the lounge area was very busy. My husband had the seafood bomb, which he said was excellent. I had fish and chips, which was very good.“ Customers` Favorites “I had wonderful time at this Olive Garden. Our server Jack was so nice and talkative. Almost as if he was a longtime friend. He was super accommodating with our allergies. I appreciated everything he did for us especially since we were a large group. Food was out super quick and the area was super clean. Definitely recommend this place and our server to our friends.“ Customers` Favorites “Great food,good pizza and great service 👍🏿“ Customers` Favorites “Delicious Italian sub, one of the best I’ve ever had!“ Customers` Favorites “3 Restaurant is my new favorite brunch spot. Kerry-Lynn and her trainee did a fabulous job waiting on us this past Sunday. The attention to detail and attentiveness didn't go unnoticed. I was a huge fan of the Pickle Bloody Mary. Everything from the Buffalo Cauliflower to the two brunch entrees we're delicious and seasoned to perfection. I'm glad we took the half-hour jaunt to try this place out. Look forward to visiting again for brunch and try dinner!“ Customers` Favorites “We had an issue with Grub Hub, and ended up having the restaurant cancel the order (ordered large but they only had the small dough at the time, which I didn’t think would feed the family, they were very obliging in canceling) we ordered from Papa Gino’s which was more money, and honestly not great, my son (ASD and ARFID) didn’t like it and refused to eat because it was cold. Rocco’s then delivered a large caramelized onion, and gave it to us for free (we owe you a double tip next time, my husband forgot in the confusion). My son immediately dove in eating the onions off the piece and the rest of the piece of pizza. You have made a customer out of us. Not only because of the excellent customer service but the food was very good and reasonably priced. Can’t wait to try some of the other dishes as well, due to the reviews.“ Customers` Favorites “Amazing drinks & great service“ Customers` Favorites “Freshest foods-friendly staff members. Be sure to try amazing italian sandwiches, delicious buffalo chicken pizza, scruptious mozzarella sticks and toasted ravioli, in addition to their veggie wraps and chicken salad......and don’t forget the GELATO for dessert!“ Customers` Favorites “We sell so many of these delicious gluten free shells at our shop, The Cannoli Stop, in Concord NH. Our gluten free customers love them!! Best Gluten Free dessert we have! This shell compliments our homemade 36 creamy cannoli fillings! Thank you so much for helping us bring such a delicious treat to our gluten free customers!“ Customers` Favorites “I had the best chicken Ceaser. salad ever made in my 52 years.“ Customers` Favorites “We tried Louie's Pizzeria for the first time earlier this week. Excellent service! NY Style hand-tossed brick oven pizza is absolutely delicious! By far the best pizza we've had in a very long time. Chicken tenders are delicious also; cooked just right and not greasy.“ Customers` Favorites “This is a fun, family friendly eatery that has been serving our Bellingham, Massachusetts community for 25 years. If you're grabbing your take out, or you want to eat in, this is the spot. The portions are large and the food is delicious. The owners and their staff are pleasant and efficient. The owners are engaging and invested in our town. Check it out!“ Customers` Favorites “Amazing and delicious food“ Customers` Favorites “Garden pizza has been iconic for many many years in the Milford area. I would say they are absolutely No 1 best pizza And sub restaurant around! this is the place to go for lunch or order a pizza to be delivered for dinner at night. Their spaghetti is amazing.

Young kids and adults all agreed that the one pizza was great (miracle we all agreed on one) and the ceasar was a classic that hit the spot. Added a couple of Whoopie pies (only $2!) for dessert. Delivery was on time, driver was cool. All around great experience.
