  "text": "Schneider Electric Schneider Electric SE is a French multinational corporation that specializes in energy technology, covering electrification, automation, and digitalization for industry and homes.[4][5][6][7] Registered as a Societas Europaea, Schneider Electric is a Fortune Global 500 company, publicly traded on the Euronext Exchange, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[8] In fiscal year 2024, the company posted revenues of €38.15 billion.[1] Schneider Electric is the parent company of Square D, APC, AVEVA, and others. It is also a research company.[9] Schneider Electric was recognized as the most sustainable company in Corporate Knights's The Global 100 index in 2025.[10] History [edit]1836–1963 [edit]In 1836, brothers Adolphe and Joseph-Eugene Schneider took over an iron foundry in Le Creusot, France.[11] Two years later, they founded Schneider-Creusot, the company that would eventually become Schneider Electric. Initially, Schneider-Creusot specialized in the production of steel, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment.[12][13] In 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the company significantly developed its capacity for weapons manufacturing.[14] Over the first half of the 20th century, Schneider-Creusot continued to grow, establishing manufacturing sites in France and abroad, including in pre-Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia.[14][15] 1963–1999 [edit]In the 1960s, following the death of Charles Schneider, Schneider-Creusot was absorbed by Belgium's Empain group, which merged Schneider-Creusot with its corporate structures to form Empain-Schneider.[16][17] In 1981, the Empain family sold its controlling stake to Paribas.[17] In the 1980s and 1990s, the company, once again operating under the Schneider name, divested from steel and shipbuilding and, through strategic acquisitions, began to focus on the electricity sector.[13][18] These acquisitions included Télémécanique in 1988,[13] Square D in 1991,[19] and Merlin Gerin in 1992.[20] In 1996, the company created the holding company Schneider Electric (China) Investment Company Ltd.[21] 1999–present [edit]In January 1999, Schneider acquired the Scandinavian switch-maker Lexel.[22][23] Later that year, the company renamed itself Schneider Electric, to reflect its focus on the electricity sector.[22] In 2000, Schneider Electric acquired the French controls-maker Crouzet Automatismes from Thomson-CSF and the Swiss motion control specialist SIG Positec from SIG Group.[24] In October 2006, Schneider Electric announced that it would acquire the data center equipment manufacturer American Power Conversion for $6.1 billion.[25][26] The following February, the move was finalized following its approval by the European Commission.[27] In June 2010, Schneider and the rolling stock manufacturer Alstom jointly purchased Areva's transmission and distribution businesses in a transaction totaling $2.73 billion.[28][29] In 2016, Schneider acquired Tower Electric, a British company that manufactured fixings and fastenings for construction and electrical firms.[citation needed] In 2017, Schneider Electric became the majority shareholder of Aveva, a provider of engineering and industrial software based in the UK.[30][31] The next year, it acquired the Indian multinational Larsen & Toubro's electrical and automatic business in a cash deal for ₹140 billion (US$1.7 billion).[32] In February 2020, Schneider made a €1.4 billion takeover bid for German company RIB Software,[33] closing the deal in July 2020.[34] Also in 2020, Schneider Electric acquired ProLeiT AG, a supplier of industrial control and MES software.[35] In January 2023, Schneider Electric's acquisition of Aveva was finalized.[36] In November 2023, Schneider Electric finalized its acquisition of EcoAct, a company devoted to climate consulting and net-zero solutions.[37][38][39] After 18 months in office, CEO Peter Herweck was removed by the board of directors and replaced with Olivier Blum in early November 2024.[40][41] In October 2024, Schneider Electric signed an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Motivair Corporation, a company specialized in liquid cooling and advanced thermal management solutions for data centers.[42] In December 2024, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia to design data center cooling systems.[43] In March 2025, Schneider Electric announced plans to invest more than US$700 million in its United States operations through 2027, marking the company's largest single capital expenditure in the country.[44] - 1838: \"La Gironde\", the first French locomotive - The Schneider logo in the 1950s - One of the first brochures for Telemecanique industrial control products.
