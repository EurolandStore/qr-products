  "text": "Open Microsoft Word. Highlight the words you wish to make golden-colored. Go to Font Color (it is the A with the color underneath it on the upper right-hand corner if you are using Microsoft 2003). Click on the arrow that points downward. You'll see a couple of different colors. If you do not see the color you want click more colors. Then you'll find even more colors. If these colors still don't suit you click custom color. If you are looking for gold then it should be around 193 red 210 green and 32 blue. Adjust to fit your liking."
