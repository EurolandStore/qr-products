ASMS not giving a fuck anymore. For example there are 3 people in the order fulfillment department, me my 70 yo coworker, and one part timer who calls out every weekend for sporting events… then management proceeds to bark at us because we aren’t getting everything done. How the fuck do you expect us to run orders and deliveries with basically 2 people. I asked one of my managers if they plan on hiring or getting help for our department, basically rolled my eyes at me and said “we can’t afford to hire anyone else”. This company was not what it used to be."
