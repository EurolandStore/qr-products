  "text": "The Spanish word \"Encantado\" means delighted in English. Encantado means \"enchanted.\" You could say, \"Igualmente.\" which means, \"Likewise.\" with the sense that you too are enchanted to meet the person saying \"Encantado.\" Encantado translates literally to enchanted. But it's not the common among English speech.. If you said what you needed to it for I could recommend a better word. Well, it's a pleasure. Do you mean how do you say want in Spanish? The word \"want\" doesn't mean anything in Spanish because it is an English word. In spanish the infinitive \"to want\" is querar. I want is yo quiero."
