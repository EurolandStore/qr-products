  "text": "- Joined - May 30, 2002 - Messages - 57 I have been visiting ebay and this makers name has shown up quite often....is anyone familar with his work???? GH GH The BladeForums.com 2024 Traditional Knife is available! Price is $250 ea (shipped within CONUS). Order here: https://www.bladeforums.com/help/2024-traditional/ I am Joshua Jacobs, the only son of Jason Jacobs. Since this forum post has come up repeatedly, let me set the record straight once and for all. 1. We do make 10+ knives a day every single day. 2. We are now based out of Hunt Texas. 3. We use D2 Tool Steel. 4. Many people have purchased our knives in the past and sold them through unauthorized third party sites such as ebay. 5. At one point over twenty years we were using 420 Steel manufactured in Pakistan but not Pakistani steel. That was over twenty years ago. 6. I invite anyone who is actually interested in knowing the truth about our product to see our website www.jacobscustomknives.com or email us. Or visit the shop. I have ample proof that we make knives. If anyone chooses to believe a lie, please do so, but you have been offered proof. Thank you."
