  "text": "The original User's Profile directory lives in a directory like C:\\Users\\username\\AppData . How can I refer to the current user's profile directory when using the Windows command line? By searching I found out about %UserProfile% that perhaps refer to the current username, but it does not really work. When I tried using it, I received the error \"The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect\"."
