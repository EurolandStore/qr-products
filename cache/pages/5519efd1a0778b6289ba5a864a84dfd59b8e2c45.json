  "text": "Jill Biden's ex-husband charged with murder in wife's killing The ex-husband of former first lady Jill Biden has been arrested in connection to the December killing of his wife, police in Delaware said. William Stevenson, 77, was indicted on Feb. 2, on charges of first-degree murder of 64-year-old Linda Stevenson, the New Castle County Police Department said in a news release. Police did not say how Stevenson's wife died, but according to the release, he was arrested following \"an extensive weeks-long investigation\" into the death of his wife after officers responded to a domestic dispute on Dec. 28 at a home in the Wilmington area. According to the release, the woman was found unresponsive in her Elsmere-area living room at the scene. After a grand jury indicted him on the felony, police said officers arrested Stevenson at his home without incident. Online New Castle County Jail records show Stevenson remained in custody on $500,000 bond on Feb. 3 at the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution. It was not immediately known whether Stevenson had obtained an attorney. Who is William 'Bill' Stevenson? Bill Stevenson is the founder of the Stone Balloon, a popular Newark, Delaware club that has hosted musicians and bands including Bruce Springsteen, Metallica, Dave Matthews Band and My Morning Jacket. Stevenson married the former first lady in 1970. They divorced in 1975. Jill Biden married her current husband, former President Joe Biden, in 1977.
