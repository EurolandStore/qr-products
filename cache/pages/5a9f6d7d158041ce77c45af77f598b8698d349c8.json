  "text": "small h Posted June 2, 2025 Posted June 2, 2025 I attended a group dinner at Huda a few days ago. My expectations were not especially high, so I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. We had… A bowl of cherries! Which life is not. Fluke carpaccio, refreshing and light. Smoky, oily pita. One of the stars of the evening: rakakat (cheese-stuffed phyllo with muhammara). Dandelion, which was just okay, too much going on here. Grilled squid, a little overcooked and too salty. Plus, the hummus was very loose. Another standout - charred eggplant. Steelhead trout, also too salty (stop over-salting fish!), but the shimeji mushrooms were great. And these two desserts. I have no idea what they were. Good, though! The menu changes frequently, based on what’s available, which is unusual for this kind of food. Strong recommend. 1 Quote"
