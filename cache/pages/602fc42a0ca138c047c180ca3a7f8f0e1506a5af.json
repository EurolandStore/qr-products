  "text": "- #1 Thread Owner I haven’t heard much on the manticore and considering the success the Equinox 800 has had on gold I’d be curious how much extra performance if any you’d get out of the manticore? The manticores marketing so far seems mysterious and unclear. How is this detector more powerful by 50% then the Equinox when it operates at the same frequencies? I have a couple old Tesoro lobos I’m ready to upgrade and it’s for sure going to be a Equinox or Manticore."
