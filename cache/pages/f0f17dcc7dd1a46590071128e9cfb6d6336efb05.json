  "text": "Did you know that Parmalat Milk provides 5 essential nutrients? UHT Milk is 100% real Grade A milk that doesn't use any preservatives. UHT Milk tastes as good as fresh milk! UHT milk is the same as fresh milk, but simply uses a different pasteurization process. It contains a lot of nutrients that are good for your body, just like fresh milk. UHT milk stays fresh longer because we heat it at an Ultra High Temperature (UHT) and seal it in a TetraPak packaging to keep the milk fresh. With our special pasteurization process, our milk doesn't need to be stored in the fridge until opened. This means you can store as many bottles as you want and never run out of milk."
