Whether its popping balloons, discovering science, developing the inner artist or simply learning songs through music, you might even find yourself enjoying a few of the app’s games and activities.

I am following the directions and looking in my subscription area within Google Play. This app is not showing up in the list of subscribed apps nor is it showing up in my payment history. But in the app settings it shows that I am subscribed to full access with my next billing date. I've looked back through old payments and I do not see this app anywhere. Am I getting full access for free? reached out to customer support twice. No response. Pete Treleaven Flag inappropriate February 6, 2023 My 1,3 & 5 yr old all play together while the 1 year old handles the screen. They love it, it helps eye hand coordination, recognition and memory. I have enjoyed watching my children play the game. It freezes from time to time, just a piece here or there but stops play. And dont send me notifications saying you want to play... my kids will let me know when they want to or if I'll let them. No 2-4 year old has a phone and forgets about the game until notifications pop up. But good game for kids. 24 people found this review helpful Bebi Family: preschool learning games for kids February 11, 2023 Hello! We're sorry for the inconvenience. To provide proper assistance, we will need to know which game freezes and at what moment. If possible, please send us a video recording of this problem. You can contact us at info@bebi.family. Thanks. J “JJ” J Flag inappropriate Show review history December 12, 2025 Toddler upset he cant play games he wants too, screaming toddler or pay money i can't afford? Edit - thank you for the response but after a trial ends and your toddler wants to play the game he was playing on the trial it does not stop him screaming and being upset, or repeatedly over weeks wanting to play the game. In the end I had to buy this app to keep him happy so you won. 3 people found this review helpful Bebi Family: preschool learning games for kids December 12, 2025 Hello!
