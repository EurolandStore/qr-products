Your grandmother, a psychopathic killer, has locked you in her house - you don't remember how you got there! Collect all kinds of objects that can be useful to protect your life, and try to escape before she catches you. Try to hide wherever you can while you find a way out of this nightmare. Be careful and be quiet. She hears everything. If you drop something on the floor, she hears it and comes running, but you can hide in closets or under beds. You have 5 days to escape with your life, so get into a unique horror experience with Granny Original and don't die of fright! Strategies and tips to win in Granny To win in the Granny game, it is essential to master stealth to avoid making noise that will attract Granny Granny. Move very slowly, preferably crouching, and memorize the creaking boards to skirt them or step on them only when you are sure you have an escape route. Don't drop objects: place them carefully on surfaces or on the ground away from critical areas; a misplaced bump can give away your position immediately. Take the first few minutes to learn the location of key rooms, shortcuts and doors with special locks. Use hiding places such as closets and under beds to avoid being caught, but don't stay too long: the old lady patrols and, if suspicious, may set bear traps in hallways and corners. Always have a \"plan B\" in mind in case she finds you: doors you can close, tables to go around and corners where you can hide quickly. In Granny online, it is essential to solve puzzles to find keys and pieces to open the main door or alternative escape routes. Combine and use correctly the collected objects: the hammer to remove boards, the screwdriver for hidden screws, the pliers to cut wires, the wrench or specific keys for locks. Make strategic use of noise. You can deliberately make noise in certain places to attract grandma and distract her while you advance on the opposite side. Another tactic is to throw an object into a distant corridor and, as soon as the old lady goes to investigate, solve a part of the puzzle or change floors. If you get a weapon like the crossbow with tranquilizer darts or assemble the shotgun, use it sparingly to save time. How long does a game last? A typical game in Granny online lasts approximately 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the player's skill, the map and the chosen difficulty. In easy mode, the time is mostly spent exploring. At higher difficulty levels, the pressure of the traps and the aggressiveness of the old lady increase, lengthening the solving of the puzzles. Some players complete the game in less than 20 minutes in fast mode, while others take longer exploring and learning routes. When playing Granny, it is recommended to plan sessions of at least half an hour to complete a game calmly, remembering that the goal is to escape in up to five days (attempts) within the game. Who created Granny? The game Granny was created by Dennis Vukanovic, also known by his online alias DVloper, a Swedish independent developer specializing in survival horror. With a minimalist and tension-focused approach, DVloper developed and published Granny as a challenging horror title that has achieved great popularity since its release, inspiring sequels and an active community of players sharing optimal routes and strategies.
