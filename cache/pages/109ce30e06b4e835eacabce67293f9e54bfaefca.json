  "title": "web part - How do I Modify Contents of a WSP File? - SharePoint Stack Exchange",
  "text": "You cannot simply 'repackage' a WSP, it must be rebuilt. Rename the file from .wsp to .cab and then double-click on it and you should be able to extract everything out of it. Then create a new SharePoint project in Visual Studio and add the items from the cab to the project. The complexity of setting up the new VS project will depend on the complexity of the WSP. Neither the original source code nor the original VS Project/Solution exists in the WSP. The best approach is to make every effort to get the original Visual Studio solution and source code from the developer. This is especially true if the changes you need to make to the webpart involve code changes. Not only is the source not in the WSP, but the code was most likely signed with a key you do not have access to, which means that even if you use a tool like Reflector to get the source, you cannot rebuild the library using the original strong name. This means that every instance of the current webpart in SharePoint will continue to point to the original DLL, regardless of your changes. If you delete the original DLL, all of those webparts will then break. If you are doing code changes and do not have access to the original project and source, it is very likely that you will have to manually replace every instance of the webpart with the one that refers to your new library."
