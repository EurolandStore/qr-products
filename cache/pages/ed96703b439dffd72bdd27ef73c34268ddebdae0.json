The Boosie fade is a high & tight fade that leads up to a longer, more pronounced top. It was popularized by Louisiana rapper, Boosie Badazz, who started the trend by sporting the haircut throughout his career. If you are looking for a haircut that is sleek, smooth, and subtle, this is the way to go. In this article, we will teach you all about the Boosie fade, including how to cut it and how it became a meme. The Boosie Fade: Quick Overview The Boosie fade is a high-cut, low skin fade with a longer top. The contrast between the tight skin fade and long top makes the Boosie fade distinct. If you have a diamond or square shaped head, this cut is a good route to go, as it draws attention upward. Steps How to Cut a Boosie Fade - Begin building the fade. Open the lever and cut an inch above the guideline to start the fade. Cut around the area multiple times to create the middle line. This will help start the fade.[6] - Develop the top. Using an open 1-guard, dig into the hair above the middle line. Cut straight up to further develop the shape.[7] If the person you’re cutting has bulky areas, freehand and cut their hair to the shape of their head.[8]EXPERT TIPHair StylistYan Kandkhorov is a Hair Stylist and Owner of K&S Salon, a hair salon based in New York City's Meatpacking District.

It can result in a lopsided cut or uneven shape. If your client has their legs crossed, kindly ask that they uncross them and sit up straight so you can make sure their hair is even. - Flick out. Using a 0-guard with a closed lever, flick out from the middle line upwards to further aid in the blend. This will make the shape begin to pop.[9] - Accentuate the bottom. Grab a closed lever with no guard. Using the same “flick out” technique, start cutting from the bottom of the fade up to the middle line. This will blend the top and bottom and you will start to see the Boosie fade form.[10] - Define the shape. Focusing on the back, freehand and dig into the long hair at a slope so that the fade comes in smooth at the crown, which is the point where the temple and hairline meet.[11] - Line up your client. Sharply cut your client’s hairline into a straight, horizontal line. Spray hairspray beforehand if you want a crispier lineup, as it stiffens the hairline.[12] Expert Q&A Video Tips References - ↑ https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/10/lil-boosie-hip-hop-louisiana-prison - ↑ https://neonmusic.co.uk/the-rise-of-the-boosie-fade-haircut-a-meme-turned-phenomenon - ↑ https://neonmusic.co.uk/the-rise-of-the-boosie-fade-haircut-a-meme-turned-phenomenon - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=115 - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=170 - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=225 - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=262 - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=301 - ↑ https://youtu.be/bW62aduif-c?si=0KtEsBODbcsg-juX&t=340"
