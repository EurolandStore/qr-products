This sparkling sipper is ideal for happy hour, summer shindigs, bridal showers, and more. So, toast to the sweet life with a refreshing Bellini. What Is a Bellini? A Bellini is like the stone fruit cousin of a mimosa. It’s an Italian cocktail featuring Prosecco and white peach puree. Hailing from Venice, the Bellini began back in the 1940s. The story has it that the founder of Harry’s Bar, Giuseppe Cipriani, invented the drink. The color reminded him of a painting by the artist Giovanni Bellini. So he named it after him, and thus, the Bellini was born. Fruity and effervescent, it’s a fun and simple cocktail to make. It starts with pureed peaches, followed by chilled Prosecco. Give it a gentle stir and garnish it with fresh fruit. Peaches or raspberries make it classy. You can also add a sprig of mint for a burst of freshness. The peaches' sweetness and the Prosecco's carbonation are the ultimate combo. This drink is light, crisp, and downright refreshing. So what are you waiting for? Treat yourself to a Bellini! What's the Difference Between a Mimosa and Bellini? The mimosa and the Bellini are both sparkling wine-based cocktails. But there are some subtle and distinct differences. A classic mimosa has orange juice and champagne. Sometimes, you come across mimosa variations with other types of sparkling wine or juice. A Bellini has peach puree and Prosecco. Some prefer white peaches, while others use yellow peaches. Despite the differences, both are refreshing brunch cocktails! Ingredients You only need two ingredients to make this cocktail. Plus, the optional garnish, of course. Here’s the rundown of what you need: - Peach puree – Freshly pureed peaches make the best Bellinis. White peaches are classic. But you can use yellow peaches, too. Either way, chill the puree so your drink is cold. - Prosecco – Since it’s an Italian drink, Prosecco is the sparkling white wine of choice. But you can swap it out for Champagne. - Fresh fruit – Sliced fresh peaches are the ideal garnish. Raspberries and mint are nice additions, too. How to Make a Bellini Making a Bellini is as easy as one, two, three! Yes, it’s that simple. Here are the steps: - Prepare the peach puree. Blend fresh peaches until smooth and chill them for 30 minutes. - Pour the cocktail. Pour the chilled peach puree into a champagne flute. Slowly pour the Prosecco on top. Gently stir. - Garnish and serve. Garnish it with fresh peaches, raspberries, or mint, and enjoy. Tips for the Perfect Cocktail I know the simple ingredients make the Bellini seem like a no-brainer. But I still have some tips for making your Bellini perfect. - Strain the puree. For a velvety peach puree, pass it through a sieve after blending. - Go fresh or frozen. Both work! If you're using frozen peaches, thaw them first. - Let it chill. Chill the flute, the puree, and Prosecco beforehand to keep your Bellini cold longer. - Keep a stash on hand. This recipe makes 2 cups of puree. Store the rest in the fridge for up to a week. Then you can whip up more Bellinis anytime you want in minutes. - Peel or no peel. It's up to you to keep the peach skins on or off. - Pop a raspberry into your glass. Place a raspberry at the flute's bottom for a vibrant visual twist. Variations Want an even more fun Bellini? Then mix things up and try these variations: - Mango Bellini. Skip the peach puree and use mango puree. - Strawberry Bellini. Use strawberry puree instead of peach. - Watermelon Bellini. Ditch the peach puree for watermelon puree instead. - Chambord Bellini. Add a splash of this raspberry liqueur for a twist. - Baby Bellini. For a tasty mocktail, make it a Baby Bellini. Use sparkling cider instead of Prosecco. - Bitter Bellini. Add a shot of Aperol. How to Make a Frozen Bellini Do you like frosty, frozen cocktails? Then make yours a frozen Bellini! It’s light, refreshing, and a great way to beat the heat. Plus, it’s even easier to make than a regular Bellini. Here are the steps for making a frozen Bellini: - Blend. Add the peaches, Prosecco, peach juice or nectar (optional), and ice cubes to a blender. Blend until smooth. - Pour. Pour the frozen cocktail into a champagne flute or glass of choice. - Garnish it and serve. Garnish it with a peach slice, and enjoy."
