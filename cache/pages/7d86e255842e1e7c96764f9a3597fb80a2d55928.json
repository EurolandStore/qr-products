  "text": "No no no requires a comma? For example, which one of the following is correct? 1) No... No... don't beat me. 2) No, no, don't beat me. 3) No no, don't beat me. If all these sentence are correct, does each is used on specific way the speaker speaks? I mean time pause between the words vs no time pause between the words while speaking in hurry. 1) No... No... don't beat me. 2) No, no, don't beat me. 3) No no, don't beat me. If all these sentence are correct, does each is used on specific way the speaker speaks? I mean time pause between the words vs no time pause between the words while speaking in hurry."
