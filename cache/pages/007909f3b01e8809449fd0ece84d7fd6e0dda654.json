  "text": "Welcome to Nexus Mods Since 2001, we have made it our mission to provide a platform for people around the world to share their mods and tools freely with other gamers so they too can enjoy their creations. Gamers can mod their games manually by downloading mods that other users upload to our site or they can make use of our desktop software, Vortex, that helps to automate the process. Every month we continue to support modding for more games both on our website and through Vortex as we continue to grow organically based on the demands of our community. We host over 575,000 mods for nearly 3,000 games from 135,000 authors serving 50.4 million members, totaling 11.3 billion downloads to date. We've donated upwards of $7.5 million to our mod authors through Donation Points. Vortex is the current mod manager from Nexus Mods. It is designed to make modding your game as simple as possible for new users, while still providing enough control for more experienced veterans of the modding scene. Our approach with Vortex aims to take complex tasks such as sorting your load order or managing your mod files and automates as much of the process as possible with the goal of having you achieve a stable modded game with minimal effort. We want to help you spend less time modding and more time playing your games. The Nexus Mods App is the currently-in-development successor to Vortex and is a mod installer, creator and manager for all your popular games. Easy to use, runs on your standard Windows PC and Linux alike. Don't waste time troubleshooting, play your games, fill those knees with arrows and most importantly, Have Fun!"
