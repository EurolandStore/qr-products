Black fixtures deliver contrast amid white cabinetry and shiplap walls. 09 of 75 Perfectly French Kitchen Credit: Brie Williams Natural elements, including limestone, marble, and pickled poplar on the ceiling, balance elegant appointments, like a hand-forged iron chandelier and custom window treatment in this Parisian-inspired kitchen.

A white paneled refrigerator fades into the background, allowing the island to take center stage. 13 of 75 Transitional Kitchen Design Credit: David Land High-end materials like marble countertops and dark wood flooring infuse this transitional kitchen with elegance, but a splash of pink softens some of the formality. Touches of black mingle for an unexpected color combination. Ample overhead lighting and custom cabinetry make the workspace extra functional. 14 of 75 Beautiful Balance Credit: Michael Partenio An expansive island is this kitchen's showpiece, but it wasn't only chosen for its beauty: This large space was designed for easy food prep and cleanup, with an emphasis on storage and seating. To balance all that functionality, crisp lines and a mix of metallic finishes contribute style and shine to this all-white kitchen. 15 of 75 Contemporary Entertaining Credit: Stacy Zarin Goldberg This space has all the modern dream kitchen ideas you need: a sleek vent hood, dramatic matte black accents, and crisp white cabinets.

A grand gray island stands at the heart of the space and incorporates a beveled marble countertop. White cabinets lighten slab granite countertops and slate gray backsplash tile. 18 of 75 Glamorous Kitchen Finishes Credit: John Granen A mix of light and dark finishes combine with shimmering metallic accents for a kitchen design idea that's dripping with glamour. Gold tiles against a white backdrop heighten the drama—as do the shiny silver legs on the island. Rich wood cabinets warm up the shiny finishes. 19 of 75 Modern Rustic Kitchen Credit: Emily J. Followill A mix of salvaged wood, weathered finishes, and traditional touches create a casually sophisticated kitchen. Two timbers from an old barge were incorporated into the corners of the island for one-of-a-kind detail, and the pair of light fixtures hanging above incorporates a charming patina. 20 of 75 Kitchen Wallpaper Credit: Brie Passano Add color and texture with a kitchen wallpaper. This blue patterned wallpaper gives an all-white kitchen an instant upgrade. Although paint might be more affordable, you can find a wide variety of wallpaper patterns and designs that would be nearly impossible for a do-it-yourselfer to duplicate with paint. 21 of 75 Tuscan Kitchen Credit: Ed Gohlich Steeped in historical character, this kitchen would fit right into a Tuscan villa. Smart material choices give it a timeworn feel, while the sprawling workspace and high ceilings are suited to modern tastes. Unmatched elements, such as terra-cotta floors and furniture-style cabinetry, look as if they were added over the years, and the neutral kitchen color scheme enhances the timeless character. 22 of 75 Industrial Kitchen Style Credit: John Granen Inspired by early 20th-century factories, this contemporary kitchen combines steel, stone, and wood for an industrial-chic look that doesn't feel cold. The massive island provides plenty of prep space, plus seating for four. 23 of 75 Yellow Kitchen Walls Credit: Gordon Beall Classic checkerboard marble floors are incapable of feeling stuffy when paired with sunflower-yellow walls.

A modern light fixture above the table brings the look into the 21st century. 31 of 75 Kitchen Pass-Through Credit: Edmund Barr Completely removing a wall to create an open-concept kitchen can cost a pretty penny and isn't always feasible structurally. Instead, work with what you already have. Add a pass-through window to open up a small kitchen. Apply a fresh coat of paint and install modern pendant lights for a quick and easy kitchen update. 32 of 75 Storage for Pots and Pans Credit: Michael Partenio If you're running low on space in a small kitchen, find another home for bulky pots and pans to clear up some room in your cabinets and drawers.

Oversized Pendant Lights Are The Instant Glow-Up Your Space Needs 35 of 75 Small Kitchen Storage Credit: Brie Williams White subway tiles contrast with black countertops and cabinets in this U-shaped kitchen layout.

Lighter surfaces throughout the space, including gray countertops and a wood island, prevent the room from becoming too dark. 28 Gorgeous Green Kitchen Ideas from Country to Modern 47 of 75 Classic White Kitchen Credit: Annie Schlechter White kitchens are anything but boring. They brighten up a space, make it look larger, and allow you to decorate however you want. Try a neutral, monochromatic look for a serene space, or add dashes of bright color to liven up a white kitchen. 48 of 75 Chalkboard Wall Credit: Anthony-Masterson Photography Chalkboard paint can be used in many rooms throughout the house, but applying it in the kitchen is especially helpful. Use it as a creative outlet for artwork or doodles, or add functionality by jotting down grocery or chore lists. 49 of 75 French Connection Credit: Ed Gohlich Traditional French and contemporary American kitchen styles share little in common. Yet, in this kitchen, the two styles fuse seamlessly. Wood cabinetry with an antique glaze resembles French furniture, and the stone walls and iron details are distinctly French, too. But the kitchen's functionality is fully American with abundant storage in the cabinetry and center island. 50 of 75 Antique Kitchen Accents Credit: Emily J Followill Rustic cabinetry pairs well with sage-green open shelving in this antique-inspired kitchen.

If you want more cohesion, stick with the same finish but switch up the type of pulls. 56 of 75 Coastal Cooking Space Credit: Maximillian Kim-Bee Bring the feeling of a beach vacation to your home with nautical elements.

This eat-in kitchen features blue-gray cabinets and a mint green island with room for four barstools. 61 of 75 Dark and Moody Cabinets Credit: Nate Sheets This luxurious kitchen pairs black cabinets, brass fixtures, and a white marble backsplash and countertops. To balance the dark cabinets and flooring, the base of the island is painted stark white, and light wood upgrades the ceiling. Dark, Moody Kitchens Are the Next Big Style 62 of 75 Two-Tone Cabinetry Credit: Stacy Goldberg One of the easiest ways to update just about anything is with a fresh coat of paint. More and more, homeowners are expanding their cabinet palette to include more color. Two-tone cabinets allow you to add color without going all-in, plus it adds contrast to your kitchen. 63 of 75 Induction Cooktop Credit: Michael Partenio Induction stoves are aesthetically pleasing and a safe and fast way to make your favorite meals. This induction cooktop looks sleek and contemporary against the black quartz countertop and white subway tile backsplash. 64 of 75 Timeless Traditional Style Credit: Andreas Trauttmansdorff A traditional-style kitchen will withstand the test of time. With old-world influence, this kitchen includes beautiful white cabinets and an elegant range hood with intricate curves and trim. A coffered ceiling adds extra detail in an unexpected place. 65 of 75 Wood Kitchen Flooring Credit: Werner Straube Hardwood floors make a kitchen cozy and welcoming.

The Easiest Way to Update Your Kitchen Regardless of the style of your home, the easiest way to update your kitchen is through accessories and add-ons that will definitely make this essential room even more practical and cozy. You can incorporate some kitchen wall decor designs to match the rest of the house or go for an unexpected vibe with unique open shelves to display your most precious cookbooks, glassware, or vintage dishes. If your budget allows it, create a DIY coffee or bar space to entertain your guests and upgrade the room experience. Kitchen carts are a stylish option to organize or set the tone for the rest of the layout. Lastly, you don’t need to go wild to revamp your kitchen—economical additions such as kitchen towels or kitchen gadgets are useful and functional, not to mention they’ll give a sense of “newness” to one of the most transited areas of the house.
