  "text": "Start home page daily quiz This is new to me and confusing because it’s not one of the tasks on the rewards dashboard. It’s three questions and I went through it twice because it still showed up after I completed it the first time. Confusingly, I appeared to receive 10 points just from clicking the tile and then no points after completing the quiz (so maybe you need to get the correct answers which I did not.)"
