  "title": "Israel is not the problem but the solution for the Middle East’s future | The Jerusalem Post",
  "text": "Since Hamas’s murderous terror assault on October 7, 2023, it has been clear: this is no mere tactical skirmish between Israel and a terrorist movement. It is a clash over identity, direction, and the future, not only of Israel, but of the Middle East and the free world. A true Israeli victory will not be measured solely by battlefield gains, by stripping Hamas of its weapons, or by returning the hostages. The struggle pits a culture of life and creativity against an ideology of death and destruction. To win decisively, Israel must achieve two strategic goals: 1. Toppling the ayatollah regime, a global imperative At first glance, this may sound far‑fetched. Yet it is essential. Iran is not merely Israel’s “problem.” It is the epicenter of radical religious fanaticism, wielding terror, repressing its citizens, and racing for weapons of mass destruction. As long as the ayatollahs rule, no one is safe. Israel stands on the front line, but the entire free world is at risk. Real victory will come when the Iranian people, an ancient and proud nation, are freed from the dark dictatorship that holds them hostage. That would be a triumph for democracy, liberty, and hope. Only the United States, under President Donald Trump’s leadership, can marshal the power to make that change. Last night’s dramatic strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities proved he intends not merely to reshape the region but to create a safer, more prosperous world. Destroying the bomb infrastructure was necessary; leaving the regime intact would be a disaster for generations. Mr. President, either secure an agreement with verifiable inspections that prevents Iran from returning to its nuclear quest, or finish what you started. In Jewish tradition, we say, “He who begins a mitzva must see it through.” From Israel’s perspective, the achievements so far are nothing short of miraculous. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, the Mossad, and the IDF deserve full praise. Yet force is only a tool. We must expand the Abraham Accords and build a better future. The next existential threat Israel faces is the attempt to impose a Palestinian state. Coordination. 2. A Palestinian reality check, ending deadly illusions The Palestinian struggle was never about statehood; it was about erasing Israel. For decades, an entire generation has been indoctrinated with demonization and the dream of “return.” October 7 finally convinced most Israelis that a Palestinian state between the river and the sea would be an existential threat. If there are Palestinians who genuinely reject terror and yearn for dignity, jobs, and a future for their children, they will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new reality. Once the dangerous fantasy of a terror state is buried, real civilian autonomy, economic growth, and shared security can emerge, but only after Israel speaks with one voice. Israel is not the problem; it is the solution. The Middle East does not suffer from too much Israel, but from too little. Israel is the region’s lone democracy, an island of stability, innovation, and human rights. Far from being the threat, it is the hope. The Abraham Accords demonstrate that there is an alternative to hatred: economic, security, and cultural partnerships that benefit all parties. A strong, secure Israel benefits Jews, Arabs, and everyone who values life. A strategic asset to the free world Beyond the region, Israel is a vital ally. We share Western values: liberty, freedom of worship, gender equality, technological progress, and the pursuit of a just society. A state that defends itself from terror is not committing war crimes; it is fulfilling its duty to protect its citizens, even as the tragic cost to innocents is exploited by those who shelter behind them. Total victory breeds hope Israel’s ultimate triumph will not end with Hamas’s defeat. It will forge a new national consensus: from the river to the sea, there will be one state, the State of Israel. When that truth prevails, the whole region will gain: Palestinians who seek peaceful lives, neighboring peoples who yearn for calm and prosperity, and a world that finally recognizes Israel as part of the solution.
