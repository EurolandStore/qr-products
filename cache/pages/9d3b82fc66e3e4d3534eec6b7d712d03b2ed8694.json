  "text": "Why is Amazon so bad now? What happened? Amazon used to be so good years ago. Then it seems like overnight, everything started coming from China and was really bad quality. Anyone can sell on Amazon, and there are sellers who post reviews on their own products so you can’t even trust reviews anymore. Prime used to be two day guaranteed, now you’re lucky if you get it in 3 or 4. Items are constantly getting delayed and there’s nothing of quality anymore, and a lot of fakes advertised as name brand. What is the alternative to Amazon besides buying directly from each store separately?"
