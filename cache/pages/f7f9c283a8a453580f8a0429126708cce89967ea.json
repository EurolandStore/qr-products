  "text": "Quick and Easy Flatbreads With the help of a little baking powder, these yeasted flatbreads are ready to enjoy in just over an hour. Thicker and chewier than tortillas or pitas, they’re a sturdy option for sandwich wraps. They’re also perfect for dipping into olive oil, a soft spread, or sauce as an appetizer or accompaniment to a more elaborate meal. However you choose to enjoy them, know that you won’t have to carve out hours of your day to devote to their preparation."
