FAQs Learn more about Chase Secure Banking by reading our frequently asked questions: Chase Secure Banking is a simple, convenient checking account with no overdraft fees and requires no minimum deposit to get started. Moreover, there are no fees on most everyday transactions like money orders, cashier’s checks, when you cash checks, send money using Zelle® or use a Chase ATM. - You can download the Chase Mobile app and manage your money, deposit checks and pay bills or people from virtually anywhere. - With Chase Secure Banking get that “just paid” feeling up to two business days sooner with early direct deposit. - Chase Secure Banking is a simple checking account and paper checks, overdraft services, and incoming or outgoing wire transfers are not included. With Chase Secure Banking, you can receive your eligible direct deposits up to two business days early. If you're already set up for direct deposit, you'll be automatically enrolled. If you haven't set it up yet, you'll need to set up direct deposit to your account. There are no overdraft fees with a Chase Secure Banking account. We help you spend only what you have without worrying about overdraft fees. You can avoid the $4.95 Monthly Service Fee when you have electronic deposits made into this account during each monthly statement period totaling $250 or more, such as direct deposits or payments from payroll providers or government benefit providers. 1 For Chase Secure CheckingSM only: Early direct deposit is a service that comes with your Chase Secure Checking account in which we credit your eligible direct deposit transaction up to two business days early. You must set up direct deposit to your account. The timing of when these transactions will be credited is based on when the payer submits the information to us. This means when these transactions are credited could vary and you may not receive your funds early. Eligible transactions are certain ACH credit transactions such as payroll, government benefits or similar transactions. 2 We will decline or return transactions when you do not have enough money in your account to cover the charge. However, you could still end up with a negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee. 3 New and converted accounts will not be charged a Monthly Service Fee for at least the first two statement periods. After that the Monthly Service Fee will apply unless you meet one of the ways to avoid the Monthly Service Fee each statement period (if applicable). 4 Chase Secure BankingSM: $0 Monthly Service Fee when you have $250+ in qualifying electronic deposits. Qualifying electronic deposits include payments from your employer or government entities (benefits, tax refunds, etc.), made using the ACH network, Real Time Payment (RTP®), FedNow® Service, or third-party services that facilitate payments to your debit card using the Visa® or Mastercard® network.
