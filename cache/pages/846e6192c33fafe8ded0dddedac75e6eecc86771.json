November 2022 I just switched to CVS from Prisma's upstate pharmacy and OMG! I wished I'd done it years ago! Managing my scripts is so much easier and convenient.....and the drive thru has been a lifesaver.... everyone is so nice at the Pendleton St store.... November 2022 The Pharmacy folks are very easy to work with, great communication, very helpful !"
