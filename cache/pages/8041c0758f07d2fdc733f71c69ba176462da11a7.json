  "text": "We are where art starts, but that's only the beginning. We are the movement for the liberation of creative expression. We believe that art is for everyone, and we're creating the cultural context for how it is created, discovered, and shared. Founded in August 2000, DeviantArt is the largest online social network for artists and art enthusiasts, and a platform for emerging and established artists to exhibit, promote, and share their works with an enthusiastic, art-centric community. We have over 100 million registered members worldwide and host over 650 million pieces of art on the platform. Our members -- known as deviants -- upload tens of thousands of original pieces of art every day, everything from painting and sculpture to digital art, pixel art, films, and anime. Artists love us because we are an inclusive and supportive community. We help them find their identity through self-expression. We provide the tools, resources, and exposure to enable them to become better, more successful artists. We inspire people to create art by feeding their creativity. We can't help it - it runs through our veins and compels us to nurture it in others. This is DeviantArt. Our team is made up of diverse and talented individuals from all over the world. We take great pride in creating a supportive environment for the online artist community. You can find us around the site by looking for the symbol after our usernames. And we're not just staff members - we're artists too. Check out our galleries below:"
