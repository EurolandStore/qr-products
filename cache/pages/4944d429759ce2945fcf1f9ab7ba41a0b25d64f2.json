  "text": "Just how was anyone supposed to beat the 7th Saga back then? So just wondering as the USA release was extremely tough compared to the JP version. Like I hear that the game was far more forgiving in the JP version, and then when it got brought over in America, the game was made borderline impossible to complete because the English distributors had made the game more punishing in many ways. I wonder why certain JRPGs got such treatment back then as it baffles me that sometimes games would end up getting too hard when brought overseas. Man localization was different back then."
