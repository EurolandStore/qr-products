Coro by Salumi offers the same beloved recipes customers have enjoyed for years, each handcrafted using a unique combination of art, attention, skill, and patience. Our unconventional spices and innovative processes conspire to create new and unexpected flavors which delight with every bite. WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE? Salumi is a scratch-kitchen that slings the best Sandwiches in Seattle. We are constantly striving to make the best sandwich we can. We rotate our menu with each season to keep things exciting while maintaining the Salumi favorites for those that are devote to the classics . Old school and new school, we have something for everyone. We offer lunch catering for those that are looking to feed a crowd, whether it’s a party or a board meeting. ABOUT US Coro, the Italian word for chorus, is a metaphor for not only the chorus of non-traditional flavors in our meats but also the chorus of voices at Salumi that come together to bring it to the world. We are two women and longtime friends following in the footsteps of generations of pioneers in American Salumi, including our founders Armandino and Marilyn Batali and their family Gina and Brian. We are surrounded by a team of people that share our passion for what we create. Each of us has brought a unique palate and imagination to Salumi, making it what it is today and what it will be tomorrow."
