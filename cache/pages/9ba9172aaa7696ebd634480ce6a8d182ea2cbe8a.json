  "text": "Anyone have any experience hunting this area? I was selected to hunt the Laguna Atascosa NWR - Bahia Grande Unit. This will be a rifle exotic hunt and we'd primarily be going after Nilgai. Super pumped for the hunt but the information on strategies etc. is lacking. We'd love any recon that anyone else has. I was selected to hunt the Laguna Atascosa NWR - Bahia Grande Unit.
