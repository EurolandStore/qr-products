  "text": "DavidBenAkiva Member It is late July and the rising class of high school juniors are starting to receive the first offers from Duke. The first offer comes from a familiar place, St. Paul VI (PVI) Catholic High School of Virginia. PVI has sent a quartet of basketball players to Duke recently, including Jeremy Roach, Trevor Keels, and the incoming freshmen duo Darren Harris and Patrick Ngongba II. The first offer for the Class of 2026 went out to PVI's Jordan Smith, a 6'3\" guard ranked in the top 10 of his class. Highlights from Peach Jam: The second offer went to Miikka Muurinen, a 6'10\" Finnish forward from Wichita, KS playing for Compass Prep in Chandler, AZ and the Brad Beal Elite AAU Team. Muurinen is Finnish and is a high-level shooter that also likes to throw down impressive dunks. He is ranked in the Top 100 by the recruiting services (247, ESPN, On3, and Rivals) but seems poised to be rise based on his skillset and body of work. Highlights from the AAU circuit.
