Best Things To Do In 2026 (+ Pros, Cons & Map) If you’re wondering, “is Haifa worth visiting?” The answer is yes, Haifa is absolutely worth visiting as a day trip or a multi-day stop as part of any Israel trip, if you know all the things to do to make it worthwhile. And I’m going to share everything you need to know to do just that! Why listen to me about how to make your trip to Haifa worthwhile? I lived in Haifa for about half a year, and then in Tel Aviv for about 1.5 years. I also visit Israel quite a bit, and have traveled pretty much all over the country. Plus, I worked at a hostel in Tel Aviv and experienced tourism in Israel first-hand. Planning Your Haifa Trip? Use my favorite resources: Accommodation: Booking.com Rent a Car: Discover Cars Travel Insurance: Allianz Flights: WayAway Tours: Viator.com Airport Transfers: KiwiTaxi Haifa is the third largest city in Israel after Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. It’s located on Mt. Carmel in Northern Israel, about an hour by train from Tel Aviv. Haifa is a great place to start exploring Northern Israel as well. If you’re traveling with kids, Haifa has a lot for families – it’s slower-paced than the other big cities so a lot of families live here. When I lived in Haifa, I interned for the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, taking photos of famous archaeological sites in Northern Israel which are all relatively close. Of course, Haifa is a city to explore all on its own, from the famous UNESCO B’hai Gardens site, to hiking, beaches, museums, art and more! Map of Things To Do In Haifa, Israel Pros of Haifa ✔️ Amazing historical and archaeological sites including the UNESCO B’hai Gardens, Elijah’s Cave and more, plus many nearby archaeological sites ✔️ Wonderful hiking opportunities, from the Haifa trail to National Parks and more ✔️ A number of museums to explore ✔️ Great public transportation, including a subway system and buses, and a train to major cities (plus a cable car) ✔️ Unique beaches that are fun to visit with bars and cafes ✔️ Haifa is an amazing place to visit in Israel for its coexistence and is perfect to visit during the Holiday of Holidays celebration! Cons of Haifa ✔️ A bit more difficult to navigate (use Moovit and Google translate), and the roads wind around a lot (because it’s a mountain) ✔️ Not everyone speaks English as much as in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem (but most do) ✔️ It’s a mountain, and buses don’t run on Shabbat – which means you’ll have to pay for a taxi or be ready to exercise if you need to go up or down the mountain 🇮🇱 Pro or Con: Haifa has celebrations with street fairs and live music for things like Israel’s Independence Day, which are super fun and popular for families with kids. If you’re a college student or non-family solo traveler or group, you’ll probably like Tel Aviv more for these! Here’s my list of all things to enjoy in the city where I lived for 5+ months! Is Haifa Worth Visiting? 38 Things To Do To Make Your Trip Worthwhile 1. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you tour The Bahá’í Gardens (Haifa’s number one thing to do)! The Bahá’í Gardens is probably the most famous spot in Haifa, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which makes it the number one thing to do in Haifa! Fun fact: when I first moved to Haifa I lived in an apartment at the top of the mountain. There is a beautiful lookout point where you can see straight down the garden. The Bahá’í Gardens have 19 terraces going up Mount Carmel, and in the middle is the Shrine of the Báb, who was the prophet of Bahá’í. On a tour, it is interesting to learn about the Bahá’í faith. People of the faith do not actually live in Haifa typically. But the main reason we liked touring the gardens is because the views and symmetry are just spectacular to witness in person. On a tour you get to see both the terraces, and additional garden areas. Plan before you go – B’hai Gardens 👉 Make sure to go to the main entrance at 80 Hatzionut Avenue for tickets 👉 Hours are from 9 am – 5 pm daily. 👉 You can do a free walk-in tour every day except Wednesday. 👉 Make sure to dress modestly, as that is one of the requirements. 🇮🇱 Check out this Haifa Highlights Private Tour for a Day Trip Here 2. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you hike the Haifa Trail For some reason, I didn’t know about the Haifa Trail much of the time I was there; this was probably because it’s not easy to find online on tourist sites. I accidentally found the trail one day and explored part of it (because it goes throughout Haifa as part of the Israel trail, so it’s too much to see the whole thing when it’s discovered unexpectedly!). While I haven’t been to all of the trail yet (or even close – it’s one of the things I plan to do when I go back), what I did see was so cool that I returned with friends before moving to Tel Aviv so I could share it with them. 3. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you visit the Cave of Elijah The Cave of Elijah is actually two grottoes located on Mt Carmel in Haifa, where Elijah is believed to have possibly prayed. He also hid in a grotto from King Ahab and Jezebel in 1 Kings. The main “Cave of Elijah” is located on Allenby Road, and has been considered the main shrine for centuries. The Cave of Elijah is one of the best things to do in Haifa because many religions consider it to be holy. The main shrine has two sections for praying (one for men, one for women). Some people think this shrine is miracle-working. You can reach the grotto by using stairs off Allenby road, which are near the cable car, or from the Carmelite church on Stella Maris road down as steep pathway. It’s located in a residential area, and you can see writings from pilgrims on the walls. The second grotto is near the Stella Maris Monastery, near Bat Galim. 4. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you take in the sunset from the Louis Promenade Walking, running and taking the view of the Haifa Port and more from the Louis Promenade is one of the best things to do in Haifa because it’s near many of the major hotels like the Dan Panorama, Dan Carmel and more. You can also grab some hummus or shawarma to go and eat on the promenade while watching the sunset! 5. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you go to the Stella Maris Monastery Also located on Mt Carmel, the Stella Monis Monastery is for Carmelite Monks, and supposedly contains the Cave of Elijah. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you check out the amazing Museums 6. Beit Hagefen (one of the best things to do in Haifa)! Beit Hagefen is an Arab-Jewish Cultural Center located in Haifa, and Israel’s main cultural center for joint Jewish-Arab dialogue. It is made up of three buildings which include a library, a theater, and a gallery. The cultural center also gives walking tours through Wadi Nisnas to show and explain the art installations in the neighborhood. This tour sheds light on one of Haifa’s most historic cities and why it’s so important. I highly recommend getting a tour here! 7. The Haifa Museum of Art The Haifa Museum of Art showcases work by Israeli and international artists, and shows the culture of Israel from the start of the 20th century and its place in the world. The museum is one of the three biggest museums in Israel, so it’s worth a visit! Make sure to check the hours before you go. 8. Explore the Haifa Sculpture Garden The Haifa Sculpture Garden is a definite must-see stop, as there are both cool statues to see and amazing views of the city. I had a blast running around and interacting with all the statues in the park with friends! 9. Madatech Science & Technology Museum I visited the Madatech Science & Technology Museum and loved it! It’s definitely one of the best things to do in Haifa for kids and families, but people of all ages can enjoy the interactive nature of the exhibits. There are indoor and outdoor exhibits to explore. Topics include natural science, magical science, the Energy Science Park, Sports Science, and more. 10. Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated to preserving Japanese Art, making it a top museum to see in Haifa! 11. Haifa City Museum The Haifa City Museum is located in the German colony. It explores the history and architecture of Haifa. 12. The Atlit Detention Camp and Mordechai (Moka) Limon Clandestine Jewish Immigration Information and Research Center The Atlit Detention Camp Museum is an Israeli National Heritage Site that tells the history of immigration to Israel of Jews who were escaping the Holocaust and British mandate, and had to fight against rule by the British. The original camp has been restored, and there’s an interactive exhibit, a film, a C-46 Commando transport aircraft that brought Jews over from Iraq and Italy in Operation Michaelberg. The Mordechai (Moka) Limon Clandestine Jewish Immigration Information and Research Center is a database with names of the immigrants and activists. 13. Clandestine Immigration and Navy Museum & National Maritime Museum The Clandestine Immigration and Navy Museum is dedicated to the history of the navy in Israel from the time of the British Mandate. There’s a clandestine immigrant ship displayed, the Af Al Pi Chen” (lit. “Nevertheless”), as well as reconstructed camps that were located in Cyprus, a submarine and more. The National Maritime Museum is located right next door. It has exhibits on the history of shipping in the Mediterranean, as well as the story of the port city of Haifa, from 5000 years ago with maritime archaeological finds and information. There is also an exhibit on pirates. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you visit the incredibly unique Neighborhoods 14. Wadi Nisnas & Street Art Wadi Nisnas is an Arabic name. It means the riverbed mongoose. The reason for this is that the Wadi is a actually a dried up riverbed, and when it rains, the area can flood. In addition, the mongoose is a native animal to the area. You can also find the Arab outdoor market in Wadi Nisnas. Exploring Ein Hod’s amazing street art is a fabulous way to spend a morning or afternoon in Haifa! 15. Ein Hod Ein Hod is a small artists’ village in Haifa that is known for its shops and galleries. There are printers’ shops, sculptors, photographers, silk screeners, musicians, ceramicists, mosaic artists, designers, stained glass makers, blacksmiths, and lithographers here. Gertrud Kraus House is a local spot where you can find concerts and lectures twice a week. In the summer there are outdoor concerts as well for free. Ein Hod has a major exhibition gallery with five halls. There is also a museum of antique musical instruments called The Nisco Museum of Mechanical Music. 16. Masada Street Masada Street is the place for street parties and more; the hipster side of Haifa is how it’s described by most people. You can find trendy shops and cafes there, and it’s a great place to find things to do during the day and at night! I spent Purim on Masada Street. It’s not a large section of Haifa, but it is definitely a place you should stop by and explore if you have the chance, because you’ll hear people talk about it and suggest you visit. 17. German Colony German colonies are in more than one place in Israel. There is one in Haifa, one in Tel Aviv near Sarona Market, and more throughout the country. These colonies were started by Templars from Germany in the 1860s when Israel was overtaken by the Ottoman Empire. Today, the German Colony in Haifa is a cool place to go because it still has the original 1860s stone buildings built by German Protestant Templars. It’s a scenic street, which excellent views of the Bahá’í Gardens, and many restaurants and shops as well as hotels and The Haifa City Museum. This is another fantastic area for nightlife in the city. More Haifa Places & Experiences 18. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you visit the Haifa Educational Zoo I visited the Haifa Educational Zoo with friends and it’s really fun, with loads of animals – over 100 species! We even got to play with the Lemurs outside of their cages (we didn’t touch them though)! There’s also a prehistory museum, which is fitting since Haifa University’s archaeological department does prehistorical archaeology (I almost did an internship there). So you can be prepared, a warning that the zoo has a lot of steep inclines… but it’s worth it, and it’s accessible as well. 19. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you visit Broken Fingaz Murals The Broken Fingaz Crew are four artists who have created spray-paint pop-art murals around the world. They’re from Haifa and you can find murals by them in the city. This. is an excellent way to spend Shabbat in Haifa! 20. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you ride the Haifa Cable Car You can ride the cable car up the mountain from Bat Galim to the Stella Maris Monastery. You’ll get amazing views of Haifa, and it’s a preferable option to taking the bus or a taxi, for sure! 21. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you visit Ramat Hanadiv Memorial Park Ramat Hanadiv is a big, tranquil landscaped nature park in honor of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Walk the paths and enjoy the beautiful scenery, especially if you’re looking for something to do on Shabbat! 22. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you’re there for the Holiday of Holidays In keeping with the coexistence theme in Haifa is the Holiday of Holidays (Chag HaChagim in Hebrew), a multicultural celebration that takes place during the Winter holiday season in December every year. There are light displays and more for all the holidays – Hanukkah, Christmas, and Ramadan for the Jewish, Christian and Muslim residents of Haifa. There are street fairs with food carts, antiques and art fairs, live music, and more performances with a theme of peaceful coexistence of all the religions in Haifa. The celebration is located in Wadi Nisnas to the German Colony and ends by the B’hai Gardens. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you explore the one-of-a-kind Beaches There are many beaches in Haifa, as there are throughout Israel. Spending a day at the beach is one of the best things to do while in Haifa at any time of day, night and during Shabbat (just make sure you have transportation if you have to do back up the mountain)! The thing I like most about Haifa beaches is that although they can get crowded at times, in general they are much quieter and less populated than beaches in Tel Aviv. This gives visitors a chance to really see the geography of the beach, hear the sounds, and enjoy more space to yourself. Here’s a list of my favorite beaches in Haifa: 23. Hof HaCarmel Beach Hof HaCarmel is located in western Haifa. It’s a nice beach, populated, with restaurants and fabulous sunset views. The beach has changing rooms, restrooms, lifeguard, parking and more amenities. 24. Dado Beach (Hof Dado) This is a popular beach located by the Hof HaCarmel train station with a long walkway where people come to skate and walk. It’s populated, with bars and restaurants along the way, and people are always surfing and playing volleyball on the sand. It definitely has some Cali vibes. 🏄♂️ Fun Fact: many Haifa beaches have surf clubs you can join! Past Hof Dado beach you get to this unique part of the coast with geological formations at the shoreline that is really cool – it’s one of my favorite areas in Haifa! 25. Bat Galim Beach Bat Galim is a neighborhood in Haifa with a popular beach along its coastline. I would always see a lot of surfers in this area. It’s popular for SUP, windsurfing and kitesurfing as well. There are restaurants, umbrellas and beach chairs, a lifeguard, changing room and restrooms, showers and more amenities. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you know where to eat & drink 26. HaZkenim Falafel HaZkenim Falafel has wonderful falafel. It’s located in the neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas. 27. Abu Shaker Abu Shaker is a great hummus place. 28. Fattoush Fattoush is located in the older, more Arab area of Haifa (Haifa is a very mixed city. Along with Hebrew-speaking Israelis, there is also a large population of Russian and Arabic speakers, as well as Druze people and the B’hai people who come and work in the gardens.) This area also happens to be the more touristy part of Haifa because, aesthetically, the architecture is lovely and it’s just below the B’hai gardens. It’s a must-visit for the view looking up at the gardens and the food, which is a bit more expensive, but absolutely delicious. 29. Chain Restaurants Here are some Israeli chain restaurants that you can find not only all over Haifa, but all over Israel. Due to their proximity to my apartment and relative affordability (in varying degrees), these places were staples for everyday life while I was living there. Landwer Cafe – Landwer is a chain in Israel that has amazing breakfast, but you can also go for other meals. Try the shakshuka here for sure! Aroma – Israel’s version of Starbucks, only better. You can get shakshuka and other breakfasts here (so much better than a pastry when you’re hungry!). And they have freshly made food, including vegetables, so it’s an actual meal (no wonder they don’t let Starbucks have a hold in this country). Cofix – Israel’s dollar store version of Starbucks with way less options and way better prices, but not as good of taste. It was, honestly, a staple of everyday life. I would go to Cofix for coffee on my early mornings before catching a bus to wherever I had to meet someone to get to one of the National Parks I photographed for my internship. BBB (Burgus Burger Bar) – A burger chain that is better than most, at least Haifa, for a burger (needed when you miss that kind of thing being away from the states for longer periods of time). Israelis also really have a thing for American style burger joints, which is what BBB is. I had a membership card with them to get discounts, so going out to get burgers with a friend became somewhat of a regular thing for me. Is Haifa Worth Visiting? Yes, if you take day trips to nearby sites and cities If you’re looking for even more things to do in and around Haifa, there are a lot of nearby spots that make fabulous day trips! 30.
