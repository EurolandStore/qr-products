The first melts generated in any solid-state mantle upwelling are kimberlitic CO2-rich silicate melts that form at about 250 km depth through oxidation of elemental carbon to CO2. A comprehensive atlas platform integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data enables more precise engineering of T cell states, accelerating the rational design of more effective cellular immunotherapies. PARM is a deep-learning model trained on data from massively parallel reporter assays to help predict promoter activity in different human cell types, design synthetic promoters and identify key features of regulatory promoter grammar. Improved technologies facilitate the detection of molecules linked to neurodegenerative brain changes at very low concentrations in the blood, complementing the clinical evaluation of suspected neurodegenerative disease. Analysis of the atmospheric H2 variability over the past millennium suggests that the sensitivity of H2 to climate change should be considered in estimates of the radiative consequences of rising anthropogenic H2 emissions. A new platform comprising large-scale 2D arrays of quantum dots patterned with sub-nanometre precision, with each quantum dot defined by tens of phosphorus atoms doped into silicon, allows for analogue simulation of quantum materials on arbitrary lattices. A specialized, open-source, retrieval-augmented language model is introduced for answering scientific queries and synthesizing literature, the responses of which are shown to be preferred by human evaluations over expert-written answers. Discovery Learning, a machine learning approach integrating active learning, physics-guided learning and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, is described for predicting the battery cycle life of new designs from minimal experiments, reducing prototyping requirements. An antiphage defence system has an activation mechanism that relies on the sensing of phage-encoded proteins that enforce geometry crucial to activation and are not typically present in non-infected cells. Fractionally charged excitations at zero magnetic field in twisted MoTe2 bilayers, a recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall system, are observed via anyon-trions, excitonic complexes formed by binding a trion to a fractional charge. Bacteria use diverse defence systems against phages, including a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein, Rip1, which senses conserved phage assembly rings to form membrane pores that block virion maturation and trigger premature host cell death. Terahertz microspectroscopic imaging at subgap millielectronvolt energies of a two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is demonstrated, allowing the spatial resolution of its deeply subdiffractive terahertz electrodynamics. The substantia nigra and all Parkinson’s disease deep-brain stimulation targets are selectively connected to the somato-cognitive action network rather than to effector-specific motor regions. A multiancestry phenome-wide analysis of copy number variants in the UK Biobank genomes increases power to detect genetic associations with complex traits across human populations. Mouse models demonstrate that vagal sensory neurons transmit signals from lung adenocarcinoma to the brain, increasing sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment and thereby creating a immunologically permissive environment for tumour growth. Geochemical data from zircons show that subduction-like processes were operating contemporaneously with stagnant-lid-like processes at different locations as early as 4.4 billion years ago on the Hadean Earth. Single-particle tracking experiments in intact cells reveal dynamic co- and post-translational interactions of the TRiC–PFD chaperonin complex with client proteins during in vivo protein folding."
