  "text": "Impostor The Painter terraria-archive.fandom? Always thought that out of the 3 wikias, It was the one with the least moderation and most misleading. There was even the incident where a fake page for a \"Master Sword\" got created and endorsed by HERO when he was around. No one seems to remember it now thoughI used to use the old Fandom version from 2015 while Terraria was in the then-new update version 1.3.0.1 since then and it was straight forward and hella different."
