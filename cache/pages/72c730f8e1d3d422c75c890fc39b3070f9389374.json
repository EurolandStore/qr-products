  "title": "Pils - Paulaner",
  "text": "The brilliant, bright yellow beer is crowned by a pure white, thick foamy head. The hoppy, crisp, clean taste delivers on the consumer’s expectation; this is a beer that expresses the master brewer’s years of experience in a traditional recipe. The Paulaner Pils is brewed strictly in the Pilsener style - with the best Hallertau hops providing its typical bitter aroma. Paulaner beer lovers like to tell each other the anecdote while toasting, according to which the pilsner originally came from Bohemia, but was created by a brewer from Southern Germany. And the Paulaner Pils does justice to that. ORIGINAL WORT: 11,3 % ALCOHOL: 4,8 % vol"
