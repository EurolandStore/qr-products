Not the most appetizing color. A slightly grainy texture that reminded me of roe. I could certainly taste mussels. It was nice in a soft, fishy sort of way. 🤷 Quote Orik Posted October 3, 2024 Posted October 3, 2024 Is it a white label product? meaning, is the la curiosa label just stuck into the box? Quote Wilfrid Posted October 3, 2024 Author Posted October 3, 2024 No, that is the box itself. There's a sticker on the back giving the ingredients in English. Despana had about a dozen Curiosa pates. Quote Orik Posted October 3, 2024 Posted October 3, 2024 Oh I see, it's a \"young market\" brand from Real Conservera and Portomar, both of them excellent producers. Spaniards seem to really like their seafood pates (most notably pastel de cabracho) but I never could quite figure them out. Quote Wilfrid Posted October 3, 2024 Author Posted October 3, 2024 I grew up eating things like canned cod roe and the texture here is similar. Quote Orik Posted October 3, 2024 Posted October 3, 2024 In that genre the hake roe from Ortiz is the clear winner. Quote Wilfrid Posted October 4, 2024 Author Posted October 4, 2024 I finished up tonight with some nice Korean crackers and the cocktail sauce left over from the okay Eataly shrimp platter. Important info: It went great with a lemony White Lady. Quote"
