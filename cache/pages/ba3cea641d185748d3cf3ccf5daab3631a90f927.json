  "text": "Is the Home Depot Protection Plan Worth It? I know the general consensus with most extended warranties or protection plans is they are not worth it. I’ve actually never purchased an extended warranty in my life. But, I’m curious if anyone has experience with Home Depot’s protection plan. It’s done through Allstate which for me is a reputable company. Anyone have any thoughts? I’ve included the break down of cost below: Refrigerator: $295 (5 Year Plan) Washer: $180 (5 Year Plan) Dryer: $180 (5 Year Plan) Total: $655"
