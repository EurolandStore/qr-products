  "text": "[deleted] Rise of Skywalker Star Destroyers There is a list of awful things that can be discussed about this movie, but the Star Destroyers are absolutely ridiculous. All of Palp’s star destroyers are equipped with planet killing canons? Give me a break. Absolute garbage/lazy writing. I am rewatching them because I am prepping for a trivia event at the local brewery. Such a struggle to get through."
