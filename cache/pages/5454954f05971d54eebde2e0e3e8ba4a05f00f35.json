  "text": "By Zachary Laks | Published on May 14, 2025 As a longtime fan of Royal Caribbean Oasis Class ships, I couldn't have been more excited when I heard about Utopia of the Seas setting sail from Port Canaveral, Florida. This ship offers the most incredible weekend cruises from Florida, and it's the first Oasis Class ship to launch with three- and four-day cruises to Perfect Day at CocoCay. This ship has so many cutting-edge things to do, like an immersive, virtual train dining experience and a new upgrade to the longest dry slide at sea. From the stunning new ship's daytime thrills and pulsing nightlife to 40-plus ways to dine and drink throughout the ship's eight distinct neighborhoods, these are the top things to do on Utopia of the Seas. Utopia of the Seas is brimming with things to do for action-packed days. The Ultimate Abyss comes to my mind as the most thrilling fun you can have onboard. It's the longest dry slide at sea and a towering achievement in heart-racing glee. This Oasis Class favorite — and the best dry slide I've ever experienced — comes decked out on Utopia of the Seas with new zoom booster rollers and transparent racing windows. Don't pass up the chance to fly nine decks above the Boardwalk on the zip line for a bird's eye view of this massive ship. I can't get enough of soaring the 82-foot-high expanse on the way to a soft landing on the other side of the deck. Of all the things I never thought possible to exist at sea, Utopia of Seas stuns with an ice skating rink open for free skating during the day. Add to that two Rock Climbing Walls, laser tag and an escape room that challenges the greatest wits, and you've got days filled with endless exhilaration."
