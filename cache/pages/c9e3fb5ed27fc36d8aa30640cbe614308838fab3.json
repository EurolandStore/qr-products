  "text": "AUSTIN — After three decades of efforts to bring school choice to Texas, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) is celebrating the upcoming launch of the Texas Education Freedom Accounts (TEFA) application portal, which opens to families on Wednesday, February 4, 2026. This pivotal program — established by the Texas Legislature in 2025 under Senate Bill 2 — will give parents greater freedom and flexibility to choose the educational path that best suits their children. “The launch of the Texas Education Freedom Accounts program represents an unprecedented opportunity for parents and students across the state,” said CEO Greg Sindelar. “By placing decision-making power directly in the hands of families, we’re encouraging parental engagement in education and empowering parents to make the best choices for their children’s future. TEFAs are a testament to what can be achieved when policymakers listen to parents and make student achievement the top priority.” “We are on the cusp of a historic moment for Texas families,” said Senior Fellow Mandy Drogin. “We fought hard in the last legislative session for educational freedom because we believe parents — not bureaucrats — know best when it comes to their children’s education. The launch of the TEFA application portal is a meaningful step toward expanding opportunity, improving student outcomes, and ensuring every child has access to high-quality learning environments.” TPPF encourages all eligible families to apply before the March 17 deadline at EducationFreedom.Texas.Gov ###"
