My favorite recipe for broccoli is roasted broccoli! The florets are as irresistible as French fries. They come out tender and charred, with an almost sweet flavor. Combine that with garlic and a few spritzes of fresh lemon juice, and the flavor pops. More broccoli recipes: Try my refreshing broccoli slaw for potlucks, add it to broccoli mac and cheese, or blend it into a creamy broccoli potato soup. Don't underestimate the power of perfectly cooked carrots! These buttery, savory coins require just three ingredients and 10 minutes but taste like they took much more effort. The hint of fresh thyme and chives makes them fancy enough for dinner parties yet simple enough for weeknights. More carrot ideas: My simple carrot salad with a tangy vinaigrette, tender honey glazed carrots, or warming carrot ginger soup are all favorites. I never gave celery much thought until I tried it in this refreshing salad.

More celery recipes: Try creamy celery soup, fresh celery juice, or add it to a celery smoothie. These Brussels sprouts are crispy on the outside, tender inside, and tossed in a balsamic-honey sauce that's perfectly balanced. The best part? They're baked, not fried, but you'd never know it. Whenever I make these, they disappear faster than any other side dish. More Brussels sprouts: My roasted Brussels sprouts are simple and classic, or try smashed Brussels sprouts or shaved Brussels sprout salad. Here the Parmesan creates these incredible crunchy bits all over the potatoes, and the interior stays velvety tender.

More potato recipes: My pan fried potatoes, garlic roasted potatoes, hasselback potatoes, or loaded potato soup are all family favorites. This nutrient-packed salad keeps its flavor and texture for days in the fridge, making it perfect for meal prep. The combination of kale, quinoa, peppers, and carrots with a tangy dressing makes healthy eating genuinely satisfying. I've been making this for years, and it never gets old. More kale recipes: My sautéed kale is a weeknight staple, or try roasted kale, baked kale chips, easy kale salad, or kale soup. High-heat roasting transforms cauliflower into something magical. The edges get almost caramelized, and when seasoned with garlic and salt, they're actually as addictive as French fries. I've made this recipe countless times, and 450°F is the perfect temperature for that golden-brown exterior. More cauliflower recipes: My BBQ grilled cauliflower is perfect for summer, or try crispy breaded cauliflower, cauliflower stir fry, or Parmesan roasted cauliflower. These beans are bright green and perfectly tender, sautéed in butter with garlic and toasted almonds and finished with a little lemon zest. After one bite, we were singing its praises: then finished off the entire platter. It's one of my top of my favorite green bean dishes! More green bean recipes: Try my favorite Steamed Green Beans, Sauteed Green Beans, or Roasted Green Beans. These oven-roasted mushrooms have converted mushroom skeptics in my family! They come out tender and meaty, topped with fresh herbs. I love serving them as a side dish or tossing them into mushroom pasta for an easy weeknight dinner.

I love that this recipe comes together in minutes and pairs perfectly with grilled meats or salmon burgers! More cucumber recipes: My cucumber salsa, creamy cucumber salad with sour cream, or cucumber juice. This sauteed spinach recipe is something to write home about! It's scented with garlic, wilted until bright green and finished off with lemon juice to give it a brightness. The flavor is fresh and vibrant, a healthy side dish that uses 3 large bunches of spinach. More spinach favorites: My spinach salad is the perfect all-purpose side dish, or try adding spinach to a spinach smoothie, spinach soup, or everyone's favorite spinach artichoke dip.

Serve it alongside focaccia bread for the ultimate appetizer or side dish. More tomato ideas: Try grilled tomatoes, fresh tomato salad, cucumber, tomato & avocado salad, or classic tomato soup. This fresh corn salad bursts with flavor: sweet corn, juicy tomatoes, and herbaceous basil in a light vinaigrette. I love making this when corn is in season: it's hard to stop eating! More corn recipes: Try grilled corn on the cob, elote (Mexican grilled corn), corn fritters, or black bean and corn salad. It might sound humble, but this boiled cabbage recipe is actually extremely delicious! Boiling the cabbage makes it perfectly tender. Add a little salt and butter to make this cruciferous vegetable taste irresistible. More cabbage recipes: Try red cabbage slaw, best coleslaw recipe, Mexican coleslaw, or warming cabbage soup. This is the simplest asparagus recipe and it's the one I make most often. The grated garlic is the secret ingredient here: it infuses the asparagus with savory flavor without overpowering the flavors. The lemon zest and juice add just the right amount of brightness! More asparagus recipes: Try grilled asparagus, asparagus salad with feta, sautéed asparagus, or asparagus pasta with lemon. This delicious salad works with roasted beets or the convenience of packaged cooked beets!

This protein-packed side dish or snack is so simple but oh-so-satisfying: my kids absolutely love it! Tossed with garlic and salt, these soybeans have become my go-to appetizer when friends come over. There's something fun about squeezing them out of their pods! More edamame ideas: Try spicy edamame or edamame salad for variations. Raw fennel has that strong licorice flavor, but roasting transforms it completely. It becomes sweet and caramelized: like roasted onions but even more complex. This has become one of my favorite ways to introduce people to fennel: the roasted version is so much more approachable than raw. More fennel recipes: Try fennel orange salad or fennel salad with Parmesan. This guacamole's secret is using perfectly ripe avocados and balancing the lime, salt, and jalapeño just right. It's classic, creamy, tangy, and has the perfect amount of heat. I serve this with homemade tortilla chips or use it as a topping for my fish tacos. More avocado recipes: Try avocado fries, avocado smoothie, avocado tuna salad, or avocado dip. You barely have to do anything to rainbow chard to make it taste good! Just throw it in a hot pan with olive oil and garlic, then salt it to taste. It turns into an easy side dish in just 10 minutes. Top with pine nuts and Parmesan for an elegant side dish. How to Customize These Recipes These vegetable recipes easily adapt. I’m constantly switching things up based on what’s in season and what I have on hand: - Swap vegetables freely. Most roasting and sautéing techniques work across different vegetables. For example, if I don’t have broccoli, I’ll use cauliflower. - Change up the seasonings. Feel free to experiment. Italian seasoning, curry powder, and Cajun spices all create different flavor profiles. - Add protein to make them meals. I often toss roasted vegetables with chickpeas, add sauteed shrimp to stir-fries, or serve sautéed greens alongside baked fish. Storing and Reheating Vegetables Most of these cooked vegetables keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days in airtight containers. Here’s how I handle leftovers: Roasted vegetables reheat well in a 400°F oven for 10-15 minutes. They’ll crisp back up and taste almost freshly made. Avoid the microwave if possible. Sautéed greens like spinach and chard are best fresh, but leftovers work well in scrambled eggs, pasta, or grain bowls. Salads with vinegar-based dressings actually improve after a day in the fridge as the vegetables marinate. My cucumber salad and cabbage salad are even better on day two. Raw salads with greens should be dressed right before serving. I prep all the vegetables but keep the dressing separate until the last minute. Meal Planning with Vegetable Recipes I’ve found that batch-cooking vegetables sets me up for easy weeknight meals: - Roast two sheet pans of mixed vegetables using my best roasted vegetables method. Use them throughout the week in grain bowls, alongside proteins, or tossed into pasta. - Prep raw vegetables for quick salads. I wash, chop, and store vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, and bell peppers so I can throw together fresh salads in minutes. - Make a big batch of one or two vegetables you love. A huge batch of roasted broccoli gets used up quickly when you have it ready to go. - Keep frozen vegetables on hand for busy nights. While these recipes focus on fresh vegetables, I always have frozen edamame in my freezer for backup.
