  "text": "A feature-complete web UI for Headscale Headscale is the de-facto self-hosted version of Tailscale, a popular Wireguard based VPN service. By default, it does not ship with a web UI, which is where Headplane comes in. Headplane is a feature-complete web UI for Headscale, allowing you to manage your nodes, networks, and ACLs with ease. Headplane aims to replicate the functionality offered by the official Tailscale product and dashboard, being one of the most feature complete Headscale UIs available. These are some of the features that Headplane offers: - Machine management, including expiry, network routing, name, and owner management - Access Control List (ACL) and tagging configuration for ACL enforcement - Support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) as a login provider - The ability to edit DNS settings and automatically provision Headscale - Configurability for Headscale's settings Refer to the website for detailed installation instructions. Headplane uses semantic versioning for its releases (since v0.6.0). Pre-release builds are available under the next tag and get updated when a new release PR is opened and actively in testing. Headplane is an open-source project and contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue. Also refer to the contributor guidelines for more info. Copyright (c) 2025 Aarnav Tale"
