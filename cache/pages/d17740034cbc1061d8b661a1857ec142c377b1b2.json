I've never panned in the river because I am new to this gold stuff and have been waiting on warm weather and time, but I've heard that people make good money working the river upstream closer to the head waters. What do you guys think the chances of this stuff being full of gold? We had a 100 year flood two years ago on the river, it rained for a week straight. I ran the Grizzly Gold Trap in the river way downstream by my house two weekends ago and found nothing so I'm thinking something is catching or caught all the yellow. We are contemplating building a self contained 55 gallon barrel trommel on a trailer to run the stuff. So whats the word on gold being caught in front of dam's?
