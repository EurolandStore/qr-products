  "text": "How real students use PERRLA Emma's a nursing student who's just finished Nurse Practitioner's school. PERRLA helped her through her program with flying colors! She says, \"...[PERRLA] really contributed to my quality of life during school because I was able to focus less on the nuances [of formatting] and more on the content!\" Whether crafting a research paper or just a weekly discussion post, PERRLA helped her through all her assignments. Melinda is pursuing her doctorate & has used PERRLA for over four years. There's not a better way to put it than in her own words: \"I used to struggle with formatting citations and keeping references organized...but ever since I started using PERRLA, that stress is completely gone! It's not just a citation tool – it's a full writing system that makes drafting manuscripts that are APA & MLA compliant so easy!\" Elizabeth, a graduate student & twice published author used PERRLA throughout her graduate program. She even used PERRLA to help her draft & manage citations in both of her books. She especially loves the PERRLA Reference Library because it saves all of her references & notes for future writing. \"I can't speak highly enough about PERRLA! I tell all my clients and fellow students about the power of PERRLA.\" She relies on PERRLA to keep her material organized and ready to use for all her writing."
