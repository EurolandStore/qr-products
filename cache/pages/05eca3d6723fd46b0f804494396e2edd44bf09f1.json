Customers' Favorites Babushka's - Hyde Park Reviews The borscht was better than I expected. I had never tried borscht before, but I thought it might have a strong beet flavor. Instead, it was a delightful root vegetable broth with beef and light goulash spices! Next time I will eat it inside as the restaurant has a pleasant ambiance and the soup was too hot for the plastic to-go bowl. The food was excellent and the drinks are amazing and service and atmosphere is perfect we had an Amazing time. the mix grill was great! the service was also good."
