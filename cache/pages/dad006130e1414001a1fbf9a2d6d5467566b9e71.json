Author Matej Novota Head of Casino Research Matej is the brains behind our one-of-a-kind casino database and review methodology. Overseeing a team of 25+ expert reviewers who collect data and evaluate online casinos in detail, he makes sure that we guide you towards sites that will treat you fairly. New casino sites are launching all the time and we're watching. Our team of 25+ casino reviewers spends hours each week monitoring the latest sites to bring you the freshest picks. Explore honest reviews powered by real casino data and check back regularly for new additions. 12 casinos found based on 1 filter Newly opened casinos Our list of newly opened online casinos contains casinos opened within the last two years. It’s great for finding new casinos with modern websites, cutting-edge features and interesting bonus offers you haven’t used yet. Important: Low daily withdrawal limit (less than $500) This casino applies a low withdrawal limit (less than $500 per day). Because of this, it might take you a long time to withdraw your funds if you manage to win big. Important: Very low withdrawal limit This casino has a very low monthly withdrawal limit, which means that if you happen to win a larger sum of money, it will take a much longer time to withdraw the winnings from your account. Important: Casino operates without a license This casino operates without a license. As a result, the casino does not have to follow rules set by licensing authorities. Additionally, you will not be able to turn to any licensing authority if you run into issues. New casinos lack a proven track record, so it might be difficult to know which can be trusted. That's why the list above is sorted using the 'Latest picks' option, which highlights sites that are both fresh and vetted for safety. If you want to explore the latest launches, check out the options below. Just remember to approach new sites carefully. We know that finding reliable new online casinos is not easy. There are many important factors to consider when making a choice, and not all new casino sites are safe. Luckily, we are here to help. Our team of 25+ expert casino reviewers metodically examine each new online casino that enters the market. They dig out everything there is to find about each site, in line with our complex casino review methodology. We've designed a unique system that focuses on what we consider the most important – fairness and safety. Based on the data we collect, we calculate the Safety Index of each new casino we add to our database. With the help of our Safety Index, you should be able to find a fresh casino site that doesn't use deceitful practices and treats players in a fair way. The higher the Safety Index, the more likely you are to receive your winnings without running into issues like unreasonable account closures or delayed withdrawals. Here are the main factors we consider when reviewing new casinos and calculating their Safety Index: Size and financial stability – Bigger online casinos are generally safer than smaller ones, as their financial strength allows them to pay out big wins without issues. This can be an issue for some standalone new casinos that are not part of a bigger group. Player complaints – These are an integral part of our Safety Index calculation. They tell us a lot about how both established and new casino sites treat their players. Newer sites usually don't have many of them, which is part of the reason why we consider complaints in relation to the casino's size. Terms and Conditions – Our expert reviewers thoroughly read the T&Cs of all new online casinos you can find on Casino Guru. We warn about the discovered unfair or questionable rules in our in-depth reviews, and these findings are also considered in the Safety Index calculation. Blacklists – When we discover a casino featured on a reliable blacklist because of a relevant reason, its Safety Index is decreased. This includes our own casino blacklist. Brand new casinos rarely appear on blacklists, but some of them may be a part of a blacklisted group of casinos. Our team of 25+ casino review experts gathers all of the necessary data, which is then used to methodically calculate each casino's Safety Index. We use this number as the basis for our review, in which you can find much more information about each newly opened casino listed on this page. Note: For a more in-depth look into this process, you can read our How we review online casinos article that gives you a full description of our workings. What makes a great new casino in 2026 When it comes to new casinos, the first thing we recommend looking at is safety and fairness. With so many new casino sites entering the market each week, our expert reviewers keep discovering recently opened sites that use unfair practices or outright trying to scam players. That's why we recommend you choose a new site with a high Safety Index. Of course, safety and fairness is not all that matters. We look for much more than that when searching for a new casino to play at. We want its website or app to be nice to use. We want it to feature our favorite games. We want to be able to use our preferred payment method. We want to get a generous welcome bonus. Each of us looks for something different. The good news is that – with the biggest database of online casinos and new ones reviewed each week – Casino Guru can help you find the best one for you. Let's take a look at how to do it. Generous bonuses and rewards Many players look for new casino sites because of their bonus offers. To attract the attention of players, new sites often offer generous welcome bonuses. To help you choose, we've listed each casino's welcome deal above. Note: You might also want to choose a site that rewards returning players via a loyalty scheme, so that the offers don't stop once you claim the welcome package. Varied selection of casino games at new casinos Of course, you want to be able to play real money games you enjoy at your new casino of choice. Whether you are after live casinos, slots sites, or blackjack sites, you will find them on Casino Guru. Use the 'Casino Games' filter to fine-tune your selection of new casinos displayed above. The 'Game Provider' filter lets you further limit your selection to casinos that feature titles by leading companies like Pragmatic Play, Nolimit City, or Hacksaw. Flexible and fast payment options It's also a good idea to make sure you choose a site supports the payment methods you like to use for deposits and withdrawals. The usual methods like PayPal, Skrill, or PaysafeCard are often supported, but we still advise to check the supported methods in our review – just to make sure. Crypto casinos are also increasingly popular, although still not fully universal. Use the 'Crypto casinos' filter if you prefer using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies when gambling online. Good feedback from other players Thanks to our international community of casino players, we have thousands of casino reviews written by players. Thanks to these, you can check out what others have to say about a new casino before you sign up. Note: You can also share your experience with a specific casino to help others. Player feedback can help a lot when deciding where to start playing. Design and usability of new online casinos Of course, the design matters, too. It only makes sense that we want to gamble at a website that looks good and offers a good playing experience. This factor, however, can be quite subjective. Each of us likes something else, and there is no way to choose a new casino site that will please everyone in terms of design and user experience. The best thing to do is to visit a few options that meet your requirements and choose the one you like the most. You can also find screenshots in our in-depth reviews. Mobile app and experience If you prefer playing casino games on your phone – like most people do nowadays – make sure to choose a site that offers a flawless mobile experience. Most newly opened casinos can be classified as mobile casinos, but the actual experience of using them on mobile devices can differ greatly. Again, the best thing to do is to try them out for yourselves. Quality customer support In the ideal world, we wouldn't need customer support at all, as there wouldn't be any issues to deal with. Unfortunately, we don't live in the ideal world, and issues do arise. And when they do, it's crucial that the site you choose has quick and professional customer support that will help resolve your issues. Many casinos offer a 24/7 live chat option. If possible, we recommend taking this into consideration when making your choice, as the convenience is hard to beat. Note: For a full look at how to find the best casino for you, have a read of our How to choose an online casino article that covers everything you need to do to have the best gambling experience possible. Alternatively, you can also check out list of new casinos on LCB.org for another source of latest casino websites. Pros and cons of new online casinos The popularity of online gambling is still growing, that's why there are new online casinos constantly emerging on the market. However, before you choose one of these sites, you should be aware of the pros and cons of newly opened casinos. This can help you decide whether these are the right choice for you, as every player's preferences are different, and for some, well-established big casinos might be a better fit. To help you make an informed decision, we've put together a brief overview of the most common advantages and disadvantages of brand new casino sites. Advantages of new casinos Brand new online casinos potentially offer several benefits to players. They often have great welcoming offers for new players in a bid to create a positive reputation and build a customer base. They might offer bonuses, for example, in the form of extra credit and free spins, that are awarded after the player makes a deposit, or even before making a deposit in the case of no deposit bonuses. Many players like to keep an eye out for new no deposit bonuses as a result. You might also find that they have a sleek, modern website in place that is easy to use and takes advantage of the latest gaming technology. Of course, this does not apply to all new casinos. Being new does not automatically mean being modern and using latest technologies. EXAMPLE For example, one new casino can build its website from scratch, prioritizing user experience and creating something truly unique in the iGaming market, with modern features and great usability. On the other hand, another new casino site can be just a reskin of an existing platform that does not bring anything new to the table. It is in the best interest of newly created casinos to offer the most popular slots and casino games to attract players. Therefore, many of them go out of their way to give players the opportunity to play the latest slots and casino games that are popular at the moment. If you are a fan of new casino games, you will find them at many new online casinos. Just make sure to choose the right one for you. Disadvantages of new casinos On the flip side of the coin, we should also treat new casino sites with caution. Offering a sharp design and the latest games doesn't automatically give new sites a high rating on Casino Guru, because our reviews are based on fairness and safety reflected in our Safety Index. Casinos must earn a high Safety Index by treating customers fairly and offering a reliable service. Brand new online casinos won't have had the chance to do that, and it's possible that they won't perform well in the future and go on to earn a low rating. To alert our customers to a new entry on our list, we give the latest sites a 'Fresh' rating. This is neither positive nor negative; it simply means the casino must prove itself to us before we trust it enough to recommend it to you – think of it as a type of learner's plate, only for an internet casino instead of a car. This will disappear once we have more knowledge about the site in question. Note: For the rest of the new casinos on the list, you'll see a positive or negative rating under their name along with information about their features and offers. You can read more about how we arrive at these ratings in our How we review online casinos article that mentions the specific criteria that our team of experts uses. New online casinos to avoid We've already covered how to choose the best new casino for you, but it's also important to know which sites to avoid. As we have the biggest database of gambling sites on the internet, you can find reviews of virtually all casinos on Casino Guru – including the bad ones. We do this to help players like you find relevant information about any site they might be considering. If you stumble across a new casino you haven't heard of, it's always a good idea to read our review and check out the casino's Safety Index. If the Safety Index is low or you see other negative signs uncovered by our reviewers, we recommend you stay away from the site. EXAMPLE Relatively recently, we've discovered quite a few sites that try to imitate a legitimate casino, give players large bonuses, let them win, and then demand a payment to \"unlock\" their winnings. Of course, players who send the payment will never see their winnings, as they were never real. We labeled these sites with a 'Scam casino' warning and warned players about these issues. If you see anything like that, you should definitely stay away. How to stay safe in new online casinos New casino sites can be exciting and fresh, but they can also come with significant downsides. Most importantly, their quality has not been proven by time yet. That's why it's important to treat them with caution. Here are some steps we recommend taking when playing at one of the newest online casinos: Choose wisely – The specific site you choose matters a lot. We've used all the information our reviewers were able to find to evaluate the safety and fairness of each new gambling site listed on this page. Use it to choose an option that will allow you to play without running into significant issues. Beware of bonuses that seem too good to be true – Many new online casinos offer sky-high welcome packages to attract players. These often come with unfavorable conditions that will make it very difficult to actually win real money from the bonus. We recommend choosing a bonus with favorable wagering requirements and fair conditions. Stick to safer gambling principles – Playing at a newly opened casino with cutting-edge features and new titles can be captivating. That's why we recommend setting limits in advance, so that you don't spend more than you wanted to. Read our safer gambling guide for more information. Get assistance, if needed – If you run into any issues, try reaching out to the casino's customer support for help. Note: If you think the casino has mistreated you and the customer support hasn’t been helpful, you can reach out to us. Casino Guru offers a dispute mediation service that allows you to submit a complaint and get assisted by one of our 20+ complaint specialists. How to find newest online casinos with bonuses The competition between brand new casino sites is intense and their marketing teams are constantly looking for ways to attract new players. Online casino bonuses are one of the most important of these marketing methods. They allow the newest online casinos to attract publicity while also offering players the chance to get off to a good start. New casinos in 2026 have a range of bonuses for us to look through, but how can we be sure to pick out the best ones and avoid those with questionable qualities? Casino Guru can help you with this. Selecting the 'Latest' tab in our list of online casino bonuses will set you out all the bonuses on offer from the latest online casinos, as well as new offers from established sites. To easily find offers from new casino sites, simply select the 'From just opened casinos' sorting option. This will reorder the list and display bonuses from new casinos at the top. Now, all you need to do is browse the list and choose the best new casino bonus offer for you. You can also make your search easier by filtering the bonus offers according to different criteria, such as value, bonus type, or wagering requirements. Browse through our list of filters and choose the options that fit your preferences. For example, if you are looking for new no deposit bonuses, select the relevant option in the 'Bonus Type' filter. Once you do this, you'll end up with a list of new bonus offers from new casinos tailored specifically to your preferences. It is important to always review the terms and conditions for each new casino bonus before claiming it. We know that reading through the T&Cs can be a tedious task, which is why we've summarized them for you in the information box of each bonus. Don't forget to also check the Safety Index of the casino offering the bonus or read its full review by our team of experts. Note: If you're not sure about how casino bonuses work, wagering requirements, or anything else related to casino bonuses, we recommend you read our detailed guide to online casino bonuses. How to start playing at a new casino If you are new to online gambling and don't know how to begin, here are the steps to take to start playing real money games: Choose a new casino – You will find many great sites at the top of this page, and we've also covered how to select the best one for you. Compare your options and choose where you'd like to start playing. Sign up – Once you land on the casino's website, you will most likely see a button or a form to sign up. Fill in all the required information and proceed through the steps. Make sure to use your truthful and correct personal information when creating your account. Verify your contact information – You will receive an e-mail and/or a text message to verify the details you've entered. Proceed through the verification steps. Fund your account – If you want to play real money games at your new casino of choice, you will need to make a deposit. Go to the 'Cashier' section (or similar), choose your preferred payment method, and proceed through the steps. Start playing – You are ready to play your favorite games. Just browse the game library, choose a game, select your bet size, and start playing. If you manage to win and want to cash out your money, you can request a withdrawal. This process is usually very similar to the way you deposited money into your account, just works in the opposite direction. Try to locate the 'Withdrawal' section and follow the steps presented by the casino. If you are not sure, contact the customer support. Note: At some point, you will most likely be asked to verify your personal information through a so-called KYC procedure. The casino will ask you to provide your identity documents and a proof of address to verify that you've entered correct information during registration and are eligible to gamble online. Frequently asked questions about new online casinos Is it safe to play in new online casinos? Playing in online casinos always carries some level of risk, but it's true that it can be higher when playing on newly opened casino websites. Established and reputable online casinos are usually the safest options, as their quality has already been proven by time and the number of players using their services. For this reason, playing in new online casinos can be considered riskier, at least when compared to time-proven ones with thousands of players. How often are new online casino websites created? The online gambling market is extremely competitive, and new casino brands are created all the time. There are tens of new casino websites released each week globally. However, the number of newly released gambling websites that are available to you will vary based on your country, as not all casinos accept players from all countries. What are the benefits of playing in new online casinos? New casino sites need something to differentiate themselves from the tough competition and established brands in order to have a chance to succeed. For this reason, they usually have modern, feature-rich websites with wide selection of modern games. Additionally, they also tend to offer interesting bonuses to new players. However, it's important you are aware of their shortcomings as well, mainly the fact that their quality hasn't been proven by time yet. What are the drawbacks of new online casinos? Despite their benefits of modern features, wide selection of games and interesting bonus offers, new online casinos should be approached with caution. Because they are new, their qualities have not been proven by time yet. As a result of this, you are more likely to run into issues in general, at least when compared to high-quality established casinos that have already earned the trust of thousands of players. Do new online casinos offer bonuses? Absolutely. In fact, new casino sites rely on bonus offers as the most effective tool to catch the attention of new players and build their customer base. That's why you will frequently find the most attractive bonuses for new players at these casinos. You can easily check what bonuses are on offer at new online casinos in our database. If you scroll up to the casino list, you'll see this information displayed next to each casino. Alternatively, you can go to our list of casino bonuses and select the 'From just opened casinos' sorting option. This will allow you to see bonus offers from brand new casinos at the top of the page. Are new casinos better than established sites? Because of the vastness of the online casino world, it is difficult to answer this question simply. Some new casinos come to the market with unique features and interesting promotions; however, not all do. Also, as new casinos have not been on the market for a long time, it is hard to tell how fair they are and how they are going to treat players. Therefore, it is best to approach them individually and read our reviews of new casinos before registering. What payment methods are available at new casino sites? This is where new casinos often shine. Virtually all of them support the usual methods, like bank transfer, Visa, or Mastercard, but many also support prepaid vouchers like Paysafecard, e-wallets, or even crypto. Of course, individual casinos support different deposit methods, which you can see listed next to each new casino on this page. Can I play at new online casinos on my mobile? Yes, of course. Today, many players prefer playing on their phones, so the vast majority of new online casino websites are optimized for mobile devices. This means that you can play whenever you wish, even when you don't have access to your computer. You can access the majority of casinos directly through your browser. However, many casinos also have an app that you can download to your phone or tablet if you find it more convenient. To make sure you find only mobile-optimized casinos on this list, tick the box next to the 'Mobile-friendly casinos' option in the 'Popular Filters' section. How do I choose a good new online casino? Firstly, the most important thing you should consider is the safety and fairness of the new casino. Our Safety Index and expert reviews are here to help you with this. Simply pick a new casino from our list and click on 'Read Review' to learn all the details. Secondly, you also want the new casino to match your specific preferences. Use our wide range of filters to customize the list based on your favorite games, game providers, payment methods, and more. Am I more likely to win at new online casinos? No. Your odds of winning should be more or less the same at any reputable online casino, regardless of how long it has been operating. To ensure fairness, the results of all casino games are determined by a Random Number Generator (RNG). Therefore, your chances of winning at a new online casino depend on the casino games you play, as they may have a different Return to Player (RTP), not on the casino's age.
