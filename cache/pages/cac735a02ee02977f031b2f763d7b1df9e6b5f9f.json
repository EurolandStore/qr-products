  "text": "Community Refugee & Immigration Services In 1995, Community Refugee & Immigration Services (CRIS) was established to fill a critical gap in refugee services. Starting in a humble garage next to the Lao Temple on Columbus’ east side, CRIS has grown into a beacon of hope for tens of thousands of refugees and immigrants. Today, as the notion of welcome faces historic challenges, CRIS remains resolute. For 30 years, we've offered essential services like immigration legal assistance, employment preparation and job placement, case management, advocacy and more—all while saying \"You are welcome.\" Together, we can build the next 30 years of welcome in Central Ohio. Explore our website to learn more about who we are, what we do, and how you can be a part of it. Engagement Opportunities You have the power to create better opportunities for New Americans in your community."
