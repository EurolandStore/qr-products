How to Convert PPM to PPB Parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb) are both units used to measure the concentration of a substance in a solution or mixture. The key difference between them lies in the scale: - parts per million (ppm): 1 part substance per 1,000,000 parts solution - parts per billion (ppb): 1 part substance per 1,000,000,000 parts solution To convert a concentration in ppm to ppb, you need to know the conversion ratio between them to adjust the scale, then use the ppm to ppb formula to find the result. Since one million (106) is one thousand times smaller than one billion (109), the conversion ratio is 1,000 ppm/ppb. PPM to PPB Formula Therefore, the formula to convert ppm to ppb is: ppm × 1,000 = ppb So, to convert parts per million to parts per billion, multiply the concentration in ppm by 1,000. You can reverse this formula and divide by 1,000 to convert ppb to ppm. For example, let’s convert 3 ppm of a pollutant in water to parts per billion. Substitute 3 ppm in the formula above to solve. 3 ppm × 1,000 = 3,000 ppb Thus, a concentration of 3 ppm is equivalent to 3000 ppb. You can also use our ppm converter to convert a concentration in parts per million to other measurements."
