    "snippet": "If your research paper is not appearing in Google Scholar, even though it’s published on a journal’s website, it’s likely because the site or paper isn’t properly indexed by Google Scholar. Google Scholar automatically indexes content, but it has specific criteria for inclusion. First, ensure the journal’s website is configured correctly."
