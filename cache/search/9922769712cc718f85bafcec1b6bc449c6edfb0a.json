    "snippet": "Nov 15, 2022 · Rate my professor is one data point. It tends to work better for gen-Ed’s and weed out classes. It’s great for first years that need aggregated info about who to avoid. It’ll tell you if a professor routinely ask the class to stay late or locks the doors 5 minutes after class start. Reading the comments is more helpful than the rating."
